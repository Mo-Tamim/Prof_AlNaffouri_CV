We propose a new technique called bounded perturbation regularization (BPR). In the proposed BPR method, a perturbation with a bounded norm is allowed into the linear transformation matrix to improve the singular-value structure. Following this, the problem is formulated as a min–max optimization problem. Next, the min–max problem is converted to an equivalent minimization problem to estimate the unknown vector quantity.

The main objective is to present efficient blind source separation (BSS) algorithms dedicated to moderate or high-order QAM constellations. Four new iterative batch BSS algorithms are presented dealing with the multimodulus (MM) and alphabet matched (AM) criteria. For the optimization of these cost functions, iterative methods of Givens and hyperbolic rotations are used. A pre-whitening operation is also utilized to reduce the complexity of design problem. It is noticed that the designed algorithms using Givens rotations gives satisfactory performance only for large number of samples. However, for small number of samples, the algorithms designed by combining both Givens and hyperbolic rotations compensate for the ill-whitening that occurs in this case and thus improves the performance. Two algorithms dealing with the MM criterion are presented for moderate order QAM signals such as 16-QAM. The other two dealing with the AM criterion are presented for high-order QAM signals. These methods are finally compared with the state of art batch BSS algorithms in terms of signal-to-interference and noise ratio, symbol error rate and convergence rate.

Due to wind and atmospheric conditions, outdoor millimeter wave antenna elements are subject to full or partial blockages from a plethora of particles like dirt, salt, ice, and water droplets. Handheld devices are also subject to blockages from random finger placement and/or finger prints. These blockages cause absorption and scattering to the signal incident on the array, modify the array geometry, and distort the far-field radiation pattern of the array. This paper studies the effects of blockages on the far-field radiation pattern of linear arrays and proposes several array diagnosis techniques for millimeter wave antenna arrays. The proposed techniques jointly estimate the locations of the blocked antennas and the induced attenuation and phase-shifts given knowledge of the angles of arrival/departure.

Al-Naffouri and Mohamed-Slim Alouini,Signal Processing,Fluctuations of the SNR at the output of the MVDR with regularized Tyler estimators,2017,135,,1 - 8,"Abstract This paper analyzes the statistical properties of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the output of the Capon's minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformers when operating over impulsive noises. Particularly, we consider the supervised case in which the receiver employs the regularized Tyler estimator in order to estimate the covariance matrix of the interference-plus-noise process using n observations of size N×1. The choice for the regularized Tyler estimator (RTE) is motivated by its resilience to the presence of outliers and its regularization parameter that guarantees a good conditioning of the covariance estimate. Of particular interest in this paper is the derivation of the second order statistics of the SINR. To achieve this goal, we consider two different approaches. The first one is based on considering the classical regime, referred to as the n-large regime, in which N is assumed to be fixed while n grows to infinity. The second approach is built upon recent results developed within the framework of random matrix theory and assumes that N and n grow large together. Numerical results are provided in order to compare between the accuracies of each regime under different settings.","MVDR beamforming, Robust estimators, Regularized Tyler estimator, Central limit theorem",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sigpro.2016.12.023,,Jan,Published,,2017-01-01 00:00:00,0165-1684,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165168416303760

Cowan,Signal Processing,Convergence and tracking analysis of a variable normalised LMF (XE-NLMF) algorithm,2009,89,5,778 - 790,"Abstract The least-mean-fourth (LMF) algorithm is known for its fast convergence and lower steady state error, especially in sub-Gaussian noise environments. Recent work on normalised versions of the LMF algorithm has further enhanced its stability and performance in both Gaussian and sub-Gaussian noise environments. For example, the recently developed normalised LMF (XE-NLMF) algorithm is normalised by the mixed signal and error powers, and weighted by a fixed mixed-power parameter. Unfortunately, this algorithm depends on the selection of this mixing parameter. In this work, a time-varying mixed-power parameter technique is introduced to overcome this dependency. A convergence analysis, transient analysis, and steady-state behaviour of the proposed algorithm are derived and verified through simulations. An enhancement in performance is obtained through the use of this technique in two different scenarios. Moreover, the tracking analysis of the proposed algorithm is carried out in the presence of two sources of nonstationarities: (1) carrier frequency offset between transmitter and receiver and (2) random variations in the environment. Close agreement between analysis and simulation results is obtained. The results show that, unlike in the stationary case, the steady-state excess mean-square error is not a monotonically increasing function of the step size.","LMS, LMF, NLMF, NLMS, Adaptive filtering, Equalisation",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sigpro.2008.10.022,,Jan,Published,,2009-01-01 00:00:00,0165-1684,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165168408003447

The nonlinear distortion is considered as a sparse phenomenon in the time-domain, and three compressed sensing based algorithms are presented to estimate and compensate for these distortions at the receiver using a few and, at times, even no frequency-domain free carriers (i.e. pilot carriers). The first technique is a conventional compressed sensing approach, while the second incorporates a priori information about the distortions to enhance the estimation. Finally, the third technique involves an iterative data-aided algorithm that does not require any pilot carriers and hence allows the system to work at maximum bandwidth efficiency.

The joint ML estimation and data detection is generally considered a hard combinatorial optimization problem. We propose an efficient low-complexity algorithm based on branch-estimate-bound strategy that renders exact joint ML solution. However, the computational complexity of blind algorithm becomes critical at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the number of OFDM carriers and constellation size are increased especially in multiple-antenna systems. To overcome this problem, a semi-blind algorithm based on a new framework for reducing the complexity is proposed by relying on subcarrier reordering and decoding the carriers with different levels of confidence using a suitable reliability criterion. In addition, it is shown that by utilizing the inherent structure of Alamouti coding, the estimation performance improvement or the complexity reduction can be achieved.

Unlike conventional point-to-multipoint (PMP) systems in which the wireless base station has the sufficient computation abilities, D2D networks rely on battery-powered operations of the devices. Therefore, a particular emphasis on the computation complexity needs to be addressed in the design of delay reduction algorithms for D2D networks. While most of the existing literature on IDNC directly extend the delay reduction PMP schemes, known to be NP-hard, to the D2D setting, this paper proposes to investigate and minimize the complexity of such algorithms for battery-powered devices. With delay minimization problems in IDNC-based systems being equivalent to a maximum weight clique problems in the IDNC graph, the presented algorithms, in this paper, can be applied to different delay aspects. This paper introduces and focuses on the reduction of the maximum value of the decoding delay as it represents the most general solution. The complexity of the solution is reduced by first proposing efficient methods for the construction, the update, and the dimension reduction of the IDNC graph. The paper, further, shows that, under particular scenarios, the problem boils down to a maximum clique problem. Due to the complexity of discovering such maximum clique, the paper presents a fast selection algorithm. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed schemes and suggest that the proposed fast selection algorithm provides appreciable complexity gain as compared to the optimal selection one, with a negligible degradation in performance. In addition, they indicate that the running time of the proposed solution is close to the random selection algorithm.","Image and Speech Processing,Quantum Information Technology,Signal,Spintronics",10.1186/s13634-015-0293-z,,Jan,Published,,2016-01-01 00:00:00,1687-6180,https://asp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13634-015-0293-z,,Nature Publishing Group,:C$\backslash$:/Users/Tamim/AppData/Local/Mendeley Ltd./Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Douik et al. - 2016 - Instantly decodable network coding for real-time device-to-device communications.pdf:pdf,

In this paper, we propose a velocity-aware HO management scheme for two-tier downlink cellular network to mitigate the HO effect on the foreseen densification throughputgains. The proposed HO scheme sacrifices the best base station (BS) connectivity, by skipping HO to some BSs along the user trajectory, to maintain longer connection durations andreduce HO rates. Furthermore, the proposed scheme enables cooperative BS service and strongest interference cancellation to compensate for skipping the best connectivity. To this end,we consider different HO skipping scenarios and develop a velocity-aware mathematical model, via stochastic geometry, to quantify the performance of the proposed HO schemes in terms ofthe coverage probability and user throughput. The results highlight the HO rate problem in dense cellular environments and show the importance of the proposed HO schemes.

Generally, relay selection algorithms require channel state information(CSI) feedback from all cooperating relays to make a selection decision. This requirement poses two important challenges, which are often neglected in the literature. Firstly, the fedback channel information is usually corrupted by additive noise. Secondly, CSI feedback generates a great deal of feedback overhead (air-time) that could result in significantperformance hits. In this paper, we propose a compressive sensing (CS) based relay selection algorithm that reduces the feedback overhead of relay networks under the assumption ofnoisy feedback channels. The proposed algorithm exploits CS to first obtain the identity of a set of relays with favorable channel conditions. Following that, the CSI of the identifiedrelays is estimated using least squares estimation without any additional feedback. Both single and multiple relay selection cases are considered.

The consideration of asymmetric rates for receivers reflects more practical application scenarios and introduces a new tradeoff between the choice of codingcombinations for various receivers and the broadcasting rates.

To avoid loss of fidelity, the number of sampling periods (based on the desired rate) in the inter-pulse interval is restricted to be co-prime with $P$ . This condition isaffected when clock drift is present and the transmitted pulse locations change.

The users inside the train are servedin two hops via orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) technology. In this paper, we first focus on minimizing the total downlink power consumption of the base station(BS) and the moving relays while respecting specific quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. We first derive the optimal resource-allocation solution, in terms of OFDMA subcarriers andpower allocation, using the dual decomposition method. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm based on the Hungarian method to find a suboptimal but low-complexity solution. Moreover,we propose an OFDMA planning solution for high-speed trains by finding the maximal inter-BS distance, given the required user data rates to perform seamless handover. Our simulationresults illustrate the performance of the proposed resource-allocation schemes in the case of Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long-Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) andcompare them with previously developed algorithms, as well as with the direct transmission scenario.

The proposed NBI cancellationscheme exploits the frequency-domain sparsity of the unknown signal and adopts a low complexity Bayesian sparse recovery procedure. At the transmitter, a few randomly chosen datalocations are kept data free to sense the NBI signal at the receiver. Furthermore, it is noted that in practice, the sparsity of the NBI signal is destroyed by a grid mismatch betweenthe NBI sources and the system under consideration. Toward this end, first, an accurate grid mismatch model is presented that is capable of assuming independent offsets for multipleNBI sources, and second, the sparsity of the unknown signal is restored prior to reconstruction using a sparsifying transform. To improve the spectral efficiency of the proposedscheme, a data-aided NBI recovery procedure is outlined that relies on adaptively selecting a subset of data-points and using them as additional measurements.

Recently, some works have aimed to balance the effects of these two important IDNC metrics, but none of them studied a further optimization of one bycontrolling the other. This paper investigates the effect of controlling the decoding delay to reduce the completion time below its currently best known solution in both perfect andimperfect feedback with persistent erasure channels. To solve the problem, the decoding-delay-dependent expressions of the users' and overall completion times are derived in thecomplete feedback scenario. Although using such expressions to find the optimal overall completion time is NP-hard, this paper proposes two novel heuristics that minimize theprobability of increasing the maximum of these decoding-delay-dependent completion time expressions after each transmission through a layered control of their decoding delays.Afterward, this paper extends the study to the imperfect feedback scenario, in which uncertainties at the sender affect its ability to anticipate accurately the decoding delay increaseat each user. This paper formulates the problem in such an environment and derives the expression of the minimum increase in the completion time. Simulation results show theperformance of the proposed solutions and suggest that both heuristics achieve a lower mean completion time, as compared with the best known heuristics for completion time reduction inperfect and imperfect feedback. The gap in performance becomes more significant as the erasure of the channel increases.",channel coding;computational complexity;decoding;minimisation;network coding;probability;NP-hard;decoding-delay-controlled completion time reduction;erasure channel;instantlydecodable network coding;probability minimization;Decoding;Delays;Electronic mail;Network coding;Optimization;Simulation;Decoding delay;instantly decodable network coding(IDNC);minimum completion time;perfect/imperfect feedback,10.1109/TVT.2016.2585381,0018-9545,Jan,Published,,2017-01-01 00:00:00,,,,,,

This process is hectic and time-consuming when the size of the indoor area is large. The semi-supervised approaches reduce this workload and achieve good accuracyaround 15 percent of the fingerprinting load but the performance is severely degraded if it is reduced below this level. We propose an indoor localization framework that usesunsupervised manifold alignment. It requires only 1 percent of the fingerprinting load, some crowd sourced readings, and plan coordinates of the indoor area. The 1 percentfingerprinting load is used only in perturbing the local geometries of the plan coordinates. The proposed framework achieves less than 5 m mean localization error, which isconsiderably better than semi-supervised approaches at very small amount of fingerprinting load. In addition, the few location estimations together with few fingerprints help toestimate the complete radio map of the indoor environment. The estimation of radio map does not demand extra workload rather it employs the already available information from theproposed indoor localization framework. The testing results for radio map estimation show almost 50 percent performance improvement by using this information as compared to using onlyfingerprints.",RSSI;geometry;indoor radio;RSS;geometry perturbation;indoor environment;indoor localization;mean localization error;radio map estimation;received signal strength;unsupervisedmanifold alignment;Calibration;Compressed sensing;Estimation;Geometry;Indoor environments;Manifolds;Mobile computing;Indoor localization;manifold alignment;radio map estimation,10.1109/TMC.2015.2510631,1536-1233,Jan,Published,,2016-01-01 00:00:00,,,,,,

In particular, two successful approaches known as the strict and generalized instantly decodable network are compared in terms of reliability,performance, complexity, and packet selection methodology. The second part considers the use of instantly decodable codes in a device-to-device communication network, in which devicesspeed up the recovery of the missing packets by exchanging network coded packets.

In addition to modeling the effect of retransmission on the network performance, the developed mathematical model presents twofoldanalysis unification for the MIMO cellular networks literature. First, it integrates the tangible decoding error probability and the abstracted (i.e., modulation scheme and receivertype agnostic) outage probability analysis, which are largely disjoint in the literature. Second, it unifies the analysis for different MIMO configurations. The unified MIMO analysisis achieved by abstracting unnecessary information conveyed within the interfering signals by Gaussian signaling approximation along with an equivalent SISO representation for theper-data stream SINR in the MIMO cellular networks. We show that the proposed unification simplifies the analysis without sacrificing the model accuracy.
