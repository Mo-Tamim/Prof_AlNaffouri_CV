abstract={This paper carries out a large dimensional analysis of the standard regularized quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) classifier designed on the assumption that data arise from a Gaussian mixture model. The analysis relies on fundamental results from random matrix theory (RMT) when both the number of features and the cardinality of the training data within each class grow large at the same pace. Under some mild assumptions, we show that the asymptotic classification error converges to a deterministic quantity that depends only on the covariances and means associated with each class as well as the problem dimensions. Such a result permits a better understanding of the performance of regularized QDA and can be used to determine the optimal regularization parameter that minimizes the misclassification error probability. Despite being valid only for Gaussian data, our theoretical findings are shown to yield a high accuracy in predicting the performances achieved with real data sets drawn from popular real data bases, thereby making an interesting connection between theory and practice.},

Two new iterative Blind Source Separation (BSS) algorithms are presented, based on the minimization of Multi-Modulus (MM) criterion.

Then, applying iterative Givens and Hyperbolic rotations results in Givens Multi-modulus Algorithm (G-MMA) and Hyperbolic G-MMA (HG-MMA), respectively.

abstract={Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems suffer from several impairments, and communication system engineers use powerful signal processing tools to combat these impairments and to keep up with the capacity/rate demands. One of these impairments is high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and clipping is the simplest peak reduction scheme. However, in general, when multiple users are subjected to clipping, frequency domain clipping distortions spread over the spectrum of all users. This results in compromised performance and hence clipping distortions need to be mitigated at the receiver. Mitigating these distortions in multiuser case is not simple and requires complex clipping mitigation procedures at the receiver. However, it was observed that interleaved OFDMA presents a special structure that results in only self-inflicted clipping distortions (i.e., the distortions of a particular user do not interfere with other users). In this work, we prove analytically that distortions do not spread over multiple users (while utilizing interleaved carrier assignment in OFDMA) and construct a compressed sensing system that utilizes the sparsity of the clipping distortions and recovers it on each user. We provide numerical results that validate our analysis and show promising performance for the proposed clipping recovery scheme.},

abstract={This paper focuses on the problem of selecting the regularization parameter for linear least-squares estimation. Usually, the problem is formulated as a minimization problem with a cost function consisting of the square sum of the l 2 norm of the residual error, plus a penalty term of the squared norm of the solution multiplied by a constant. The penalty term has the effect of shrinking the solution towards the origin with magnitude that depends on the value of the penalty constant. By considering both squared and non-squared norms of the residual error and the solution, four different cost functions can be formed to achieve the same goal. In this paper, we show that all the four cost functions lead to the same closed-form solution involving a regularization parameter, which is related to the penalty constant through a different constraint equation for each cost function. We show that for three of the cost functions, a specific procedure can be applied to combine the constraint equation with the mean squared error (MSE) criterion to develop approximately optimal regularization parameter selection algorithms. Performance of the developed algorithms is compared to existing methods to show that the proposed algorithms stay closest to the optimal MSE.},

A recursive procedure is derived that is based on solving local optimization problems that attempt to alleviate the worst-case effect of data uncertainties on filter performance. The resulting procedure turns out to have similarities with leakage-based adaptive filters. 1 Introduction In real applications there are always discrepancies between an assumed model and the actual data. Such discrepancies or data uncertainties can be due to several factors such as unmodeled dynamics, disturbances, simplifications during the modeling phase, or even finite precision effects. In this paper, we focus on uncertainties in the regression data in the context of adaptive filtering. In particular, we suggest a procedure that attempts to alleviate the worst-case effect of the uncertainties on filter performance. The resulting algorithm includes leakage and has connections with leaky-LMS.},

pages={1574-1578},
abstract={This paper considers the effect of spatial correlation between transmit antennas on the sum-rate capacity of the MIMO broadcast channel (i.e., downlink of a cellular system). 
Specifically, for a system with a large number of users n, we analyze the scaling laws of the sum-rate for the dirty paper coding and for different types of beamforming transmission 
schemes. When the channel is i.i.d., it has been shown that for large n, the sum rate is equal to M log log n + M log P/M + o(1) where M is the number of transmit antennas, P is the 
average signal to noise ratio, and o(1) refers to terms that go to zero as n rarr infin. When the channel exhibits some spatial correlation with a covariance matrix R (non-singular 
with tr(R)=M), we prove that the sum rate of dirty paper coding is M log log n + M log P/M + log det(R) + o(1). We further show that the sum-rate of various beamforming schemes 
achieves M log log n + M log P/M + M log c + o(1) where c les 1 depends on the type of beamforming. We can in fact compute c for random beamforming proposed in M. Sharif et al. (2005)

pages={1-7},
abstract={Cellular operators are continuously densifying their networks to cope with the ever-increasing capacity demand. Furthermore, an extreme densification phase for cellular 
networks is foreseen to fulfill the ambitious fifth generation (5G) performance requirements. Network densification improves spectrum utilization and network capacity by shrinking base 
stations' (BSs) footprints and reusing the same spectrum more frequently over the spatial domain. However, network densification also increases the handover (HO) rate, which may 
diminish the capacity gains for mobile users due to HO delays. In highly dense 5G cellular networks, HO delays may neutralize or even negate the gains offered by network densification. 
In this paper, we present an analytical paradigm, based on stochastic geometry, to quantify the effect of HO delay on the average user rate in cellular networks. To this end, we 
propose a flexible handover scheme to reduce HO delay in case of highly dense cellular networks. This scheme allows skipping the HO procedure with some BSs along users' trajectories. 
The performance evaluation and testing of this scheme for only single HO skipping shows considerable gains in many practical scenarios.},

abstract={This work presents an exact tracking analysis of the Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS) algorithm for circular complex correlated Gaussian inputs. Unlike the existing works, 
the analysis presented neither uses separation principle nor small step-size assumption. The approach is based on the derivation of a closed form expression for the cumulative 
distribution function (CDF) of random variables of the form (∥u∥D12)(∥u∥D22)-1 where u is a white Gaussian vector and D1 and D2 are diagonal matrices and using that to derive the first 
and second moments of such variables. These moments are then used to evaluate the tracking behavior of the NLMS algorithm in closed form. Thus, both the steady-state mean-square-error 
(MSE) and mean-square-deviation (MSD )tracking behaviors of the NLMS algorithm are evaluated. The analysis is also used to derive the optimum step-size that minimizes the excess MSE 
(EMSE). Simulations presented for the steady-state tracking behavior support the theoretical findings for a wide range of step-size and input correlation.},

abstract={This paper presents a new method of time delay estimation (TDE) using low sample rates of an impulsive acoustic source in a room environment. The proposed method finds the 
time delay from the room impulse response (RIR) which makes it robust against room reverberations. The RIR is considered a sparse phenomenon and a recently proposed sparse signal 
reconstruction technique called orthogonal clustering (OC) is utilized for its estimation from the low rate sampled received signal. The arrival time of the direct path signal at a 
pair of microphones is identified from the estimated RIR and their difference yields the desired time delay. Low sampling rates reduce the hardware and computational complexity and 
decrease the communication between the microphones and the centralized location. The performance of the proposed technique is demonstrated by numerical simulations and experimental 
results.},

year={2015},
volume={},

pages={7-12},
abstract={The deluge of date rate in today's networks poses a cost burden on the backhaul network design. Developing cost efficient backhaul solutions becomes an interesting, yet 
challenging, problem. Traditional technologies for backhaul networks include either radio-frequency backhauls (RF) or optical fibres (OF). While RF is a cost-effective solution as 
compared to OF, it supports lower data rate requirements. Another promising backhaul solution that may combine both a high data rate and a relatively low cost is the free-space optics 
(FSO). FSO, however, is sensitive to nature conditions (e.g., rain, fog, line-ofsight, etc.). A more reliable alternative is, therefore, to combine RF and FSO solutions through a 
hybrid structure called hybrid RF/FSO. Consider a backhaul network, where the base-stations (BS) can be connected to each other either via OF or hybrid RF/FSO backhaul links. The paper 
addresses the problem of minimizing the cost of backhaul planning under connectivity and data rates constraints, so as to choose the appropriate costeffective backhaul type between BSs 
(i.e., either OF or hybrid RF/FSO). The paper solves the problem using graph theory techniques by introducing the corresponding planning graph. It shows that under a specified 
realistic assumption about the cost of OF and hybrid RF/FSO links, the problem is equivalent to a maximum weight clique problem, which can be solved with moderate complexity. 
Simulation results show that our proposed solution shows a close-to-optimal performance, especially for practical prices of the hybrid RF/FSO.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider the problem of minimizing the decoding delay of generalized instantly decodable network coding (G-IDNC) in persistent erasure channels (PECs). By 
persistent erasure channels, we mean erasure channels with memory, which are modeled as a Gilbert-Elliott two-state Markov model with good and bad channel states. In this scenario, the 
channel erasure dependence, represented by the transition probabilities of this channel model, is an important factor that could be exploited to reduce the decoding delay. We first 
formulate the G-IDNC minimum decoding delay problem in PECs as a maximum weight clique problem over the G-IDNC graph. Since finding the optimal solution of this formulation is NP-hard, 
we propose two heuristic algorithms to solve it and compare them using extensive simulations. Simulation results show that each of these heuristics outperforms the other in certain 
ranges of channel memory levels. They also show that the proposed heuristics significantly outperform both the optimal strict IDNC in the literature and the channel-unaware G-IDNC 
algorithms.},

abstract={This paper considers the uplink of a single-cell large-scale multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) system in which m mono-antenna users communicate with a base station (BS)

efficiency gains but obviously comes at the cost of higher complexity, a fact that becomes all the more critical as the number of antennas grows large. To solve this issue is to choose 
a subset of the available n antennas. The subset must be carefully chosen to achieve the best performance. However, finding the optimal subset of antennas is usually a difficult task, 
requiring one to solve a high dimensional combinatorial optimization problem. In this paper, we approach this problem in two ways. The first one consists in solving a convex relaxation 
of the problem using standard convex optimization tools. The second technique solves the problem using a greedy approach. The main advantages of the greedy approach lies in its wider 
scope, in that, unlike the first approach, it can be applied irrespective of the considered performance criterion. As an outcome of this feature, we show that the greedy approach can 
be applied even when only the channel statistics are available at the BS, which provides blind way to perform antenna selection.},

abstract={In an OFDM system, the receiver requires an estimate of the channel to recover the transmitted data. Most channel estimation methods rely on some form of training which 
reduces the useful data rate. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that blindly estimates the channel by maximizing the log likelihood of the channel given the output data. Finding 
the likelihood function of a linear system can be very difficult. However, in the OFDM case, central limit arguments can be used to argue that the time-domain input is Gaussian. This 
together with the Gaussian assumption on the noise makes the output data Gaussian. The output likelihood function can then be maximized to obtain the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate 
of the channel. Unfortunately, this optimization problem is not convex and thus finding the global maximum is challenging. In this paper, we propose two methods to find the global 
maximum of the ML objective function. One is the blind Genetic algorithm and the other is the semi-blind Steepest descent method. The performance of the proposed algorithms is 
demonstrated by computer simulations.},

abstract={In this paper, we address the problem of robust adaptive beamforming of signals received by a linear array. The challenge associated with the beamforming problem is twofold. 
Firstly, the process requires the inversion of the usually ill-conditioned covariance matrix of the received signals. Secondly, the steering vector pertaining to the direction of 
arrival of the signal of interest is not known precisely. To tackle these two challenges, the standard capon beamformer is manipulated to a form where the beamformer output is obtained 
as a scaled version of the inner product of two vectors. The two vectors are linearly related to the steering vector and the received signal snapshot, respectively. The linear 
operator, in both cases, is the square root of the covariance matrix. A regularized least-squares (RLS) approach is proposed to estimate these two vectors and to provide robustness 
without exploiting prior information. Simulation results show that the RLS beamformer using the proposed regularization algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art beamforming algorithms, 
as well as another RLS beamformers using a standard regularization approaches.},

abstract={The radio-frequency (RF) technology is a scalable solution for the backhaul planning. However, its performance is limited in terms of data rate and latency. Free Space 
Optical (FSO) backhaul, on the other hand, offers a higher data rate but is sensitive to weather conditions. To combine the advantages of RF and FSO backhauls, this paper proposes a 
cost-efficient backhaul network using the hybrid RF/FSO technology. To ensure a resilient backhaul, the paper imposes a given degree of redundancy by connecting each node through K 
link-disjoint paths so as to cope with potential link failures. Hence, the network planning problem considered in this paper is the one of minimizing the total deployment cost by 
choosing the appropriate link type, i.e., either hybrid RF/FSO or optical fiber (OF), between each couple of base-stations while guaranteeing K link-disjoint connections, a data rate 
target, and a reliability threshold. The paper solves the problem using graph theory techniques. It reformulates the problem as a maximum weight clique problem in the planning graph, 
under a specified realistic assumption about the cost of OF and hybrid RF/FSO links. Simulation results show the cost of the different planning and suggest that the proposed heuristic

abstract={OFDM modulation combines the advantages of high achievable rates and relatively easy implementation. In this paper, we show how to perform blind maximum-likelihood data 
recovery in OFDM transmission from the output symbol and cyclic prefix. Our approach relies on decomposing the OFDM channel into two subchannels (cyclic and linear) that share the same 
input and are characterized by the same channel parameters. This fact enables us to estimate the channel parameters from one subchannel and substitute the estimate into the other, thus 
obtaining a nonlinear relationship involving the input and output data only. The relationship does not show any channel dependence whatsoever and can be exhaustively searched for the 
maximum likelihood estimate of the input. This shows that OFDM systems are completely identifiable using output data only, irrespective of the channel zeros, as long as the channel 
delay spread is less than the length of the cyclic prefix.},

is employed herein as a tool for improving the distributed solution by overcoming the need for a central controller or additional signaling in the system. We model the session by 
self-interested players in a non-cooperative potential game. The utility function is designed such that increasing individual payoff results in a collective behavior achieving both a 
desirable system performance in a shared network environment and the Pareto optimal solution. We further show that our distributed solution achieves the centralized solution. Through 
extensive simulations, our approach is compared to the best performance that could be found in the conventional point-to-multipoint (PMP) recovery process. Numerical results show that 
our formulation largely outperforms the conventional PMP scheme in most practical situations and achieves a lower delay.},

abstract={Opportunistic user selection is a simple technique that exploits the spatial diversity in multiuser relay-aided networks. Nonetheless, channel state information (CSI) from 
all users (and cooperating relays) is generally required at a central node in order to make selection decisions. Practically, CSI acquisition generates a great deal of feedback 
overhead that could result in significant transmission delays. In addition to this, the presence of a full-duplex cooperating relay corrupts the fed back CSI by additive noise and the 
relay's loop (or self) interference. This could lead to transmission outages if user selection is based on inaccurate feedback information. In this paper, we propose an opportunistic 
full-duplex feedback algorithm that tackles the above challenges. We cast the problem of joint user signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the relay loop interference estimation at the 
base-station as a block sparse signal recovery problem in compressive sensing (CS). Using existing CS block recovery algorithms, the identity of the strong users is obtained and their 
corresponding SNRs are estimated. Numerical results show that the proposed technique drastically reduces the feedback overhead and achieves a rate close to that obtained by techniques 
that require dedicated error-free feedback from all users. Numerical results also show that there is a trade-off between the feedback interference and load, and for short coherence 
intervals, full-duplex feedback achieves higher throughput when compared to interference-free (half-duplex) feedback.},

abstract={This paper addresses the problemof linear least squares (LS) estimation of a vector x from linearly related observations. In spite of being unbiased, the original LS 
estimator suffers from high mean squared error, especially at low signal-to-noise ratios. The mean squared error (MSE) of the LS estimator can be improved by introducing some form of 
regularization based on certain constraints. We propose an improved LS (ILS) estimator that approximately minimizes the MSE, without imposing any constraints. To achieve this, we allow 
for perturbation in the measurement matrix. Then we utilize a bounded data uncertainty (BDU) framework to derive a simple iterative procedure to estimate the regularization parameter. 
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed BDU-ILS estimator is superior to the original LS estimator, and it converges to the best linear estimator, the 
linear-minimum-mean-squared error estimator (LMMSE), when the elements of x are statistically white.},

abstract={Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication is one solution to provide more spectrum than available at lower carrier frequencies. To provide sufficient link budget, mmWave systems 
will use beamforming with large antenna arrays at both the transmitter and receiver. Training these large arrays using conventional approaches taken at lower carrier frequencies, 
however, results in high overhead. In this paper, we propose a beam training algorithm that efficiently designs the beamforming vectors with low training overhead. Exploiting mmWave 
channel reciprocity, the proposed algorithm relaxes the need for an explicit feedback channel, and opportunistically terminates the training process when a desired quality of service 
is achieved. To construct the training beamforming vectors, a new multi-resolution codebook is developed for hybrid analog/digital architectures. Simulation results show that the 
proposed algorithm achieves a comparable rate to that obtained by exhaustive search solutions while requiring lower training overhead when compared to prior work.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a prioritized multi-layer network coding scheme for collaborative packet recovery in underlay cellular cognitive radio networks. This scheme allows

their throughput, without any coordination between them. This non-coordinated collaboration is done using a novel multi-layer instantly decodable network coding scheme, which 
guarantees that each network's help to the other network does not result in any degradation in its own performance. It also does not cause any violation to the primary networks 
interference thresholds in the same and adjacent cells. Yet, our proposed scheme both guarantees the reduction of the recovery overhead in collocated primary and cognitive radio

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of reducing the delivery time of data messages to cellular users using instantly decodable network coding (IDNC) with physical-layer rate
awareness. While most of the existing literature on IDNC does not consider any physical layer complications, this paper proposes a cross-layer scheme that incorporates the different
channel rates of the various users in the decision process of both the transmitted message combinations and the rates with which they are transmitted. The completion time minimization
problem in such scenario is first shown to be intractable. The problem is, thus, approximated by reducing, at each transmission, the increase of an anticipated version of the
completion time. The paper solves the problem by formulating it as a maximum weight clique problem over a newly designed rate aware IDNC (RA-IDNC) graph. Further, the paper provides a
multi-layer solution to improve the completion time approximation. Simulation results suggest that the cross-layer design largely outperforms the uncoded transmissions strategies and
the classical IDNC scheme.},

abstract={Recent studies on cloud-radio access networks (CRANs) assume the availability of a single processor (cloud) capable of managing the entire network performance; inter-cloud
interference is treated as background noise. This paper considers the more practical scenario of the downlink of a CRAN formed by multiple clouds, where each cloud is connected to a
cluster of multiple-antenna base stations (BSs) via high-capacity wireline backhaul links. The network is composed of several disjoint BSs' clusters, each serving a pre-known set of
single-antenna users. To account for both inter- cloud and intra-cloud interference, the paper considers the problem of minimizing the total network power consumption subject to
quality of service constraints, by jointly determining the set of active BSs connected to each cloud and the beamforming vectors of every user across the network. The paper solves the
problem using Lagrangian duality theory through a dual decomposition approach, which decouples the problem into multiple and independent subproblems, the solution of which depends on
the dual optimization problem. The solution then proceeds in updating the dual variables and the active set of BSs at each cloud iteratively. The proposed approach leads to a
distributed implementation across the multiple clouds through a reasonable exchange of information between adjacent clouds. The paper further proposes a centralized solution to the
problem. Simulation results suggest that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the conventional per-cloud update solution, especially at high signal-to-interference-plus-

abstract={Next-generation cellular networks are expected to be assisted by femtocaches (FCs), which collectively store the most popular files for the clients. Given any arbitrary
non-fragmented placement of such files, a strict no-latency constraint, and clients' prior knowledge, new file download requests could be efficiently handled by both the FCs and the
macrocell base station (MBS) using opportunistic network coding (ONC). In this paper, we aim to find the best allocation of coded file downloads to the FCs so as to minimize the MBS
involvement in this download process. We first formulate this optimization problem over an ONC graph, and show that it is NP-hard. We then propose a greedy approach that maximizes the
number of files downloaded by the FCs, with the goal to reduce the download share of the MBS. This allocation is performed using a dual conflict ONC graph to avoid conflicts among the
FC downloads. Simulations show that our proposed scheme almost achieves the optimal performance and significantly saves on the MBS bandwidth.},

abstract={Cache-enabled base station (BS) densification, denoted as a fog radio access network (F-RAN), is foreseen as a key component of 5G cellular networks. F-RAN enables storing
popular files at the network edge (i.e., BS caches), which empowers local communication and alleviates traffic congestions at the core/backhaul network. The hitting probability, which
is the probability of successfully transmitting popular files request from the network edge, is a fundamental key performance indicator (KPI) for F-RAN. This paper develops a
scheduling aware mathematical framework, based on stochastic geometry, to characterize the hitting probability of F-RAN in a multi-channel environment. To this end, we assess and
compare the performance of two caching distribution schemes, namely, uniform caching and Zipf caching. The numerical results show that the commonly used single channel environment
leads to pessimistic assessment for the hitting probability of F-RAN. Furthermore, the numerical results manifest the superiority of the Zipf caching scheme and quantify the hitting
probability gains in terms of the number of channels and cache size.},

abstract={This paper addresses the coordinated scheduling problem in cloud-enabled networks. Consider the downlink of a cloud-radio access network (CRAN), where the cloud is only
responsible for the scheduling policy and the synchronization of the transmit frames across the connected base-stations (BS). The transmitted frame of every BS consists of several
time/frequency blocks, called power-zones (PZ), maintained at fixed transmit power. The paper considers the problem of scheduling users to PZs and BSs in a coordinated fashion across
the network, by maximizing a network-wide utility under the practical constraint that each user cannot be served by more than one base-station, but can be served by one or more
power-zones within each base-station frame. The paper solves the problem using a graph theoretical approach by introducing the scheduling graph in which each vertex represents an
association of users, PZs and BSs. The problem is formulated as a maximum weight clique, in which the weight of each vertex is the benefit of the association represented by that
vertex. The paper further presents heuristic algorithms with low computational complexity. Simulation results show the performance of the proposed algorithms and suggest that the
heuristics perform near optimal in low shadowing environments.},

abstract={Network densification has always been an important factor to cope with the ever increasing capacity demand. Deploying more base stations (BSs) improves the spatial frequency
utilization, which increases the network capacity. However, such improvement comes at the expense of shrinking the BSs' footprints, which increases the handover (HO) rate and may
diminish the foreseen capacity gains. In this paper, we propose a cooperative HO management scheme to mitigate the HO effect on throughput gains achieved via cellular network
densification. The proposed HO scheme relies on skipping HO to the nearest BS at some instances along the user's trajectory while enabling cooperative BS service during HO execution at
other instances. To this end, we develop a mathematical model, via stochastic geometry, to quantify the performance of the proposed HO scheme in terms of coverage probability and user
throughput. The results show that the proposed cooperative HO scheme outperforms the always best connected based association at high mobility. Also, the value of BS cooperation along
with handover skipping is quantified with respect to the HO skipping only that has recently appeared in the literature. Particularly, the proposed cooperative HO scheme shows
throughput gains of 12% to 27% and 17% on average, when compared to the always best connected and HO skipping only schemes at user velocity ranging from 80 km/h to 160 Km/h,
respectively.},

channels exhibit high permeability in contrast to low permeability rock formations in their surroundings, enabling formulation of a sparse field recovery problem. The Ensemble Kalman
filter (EnKF) is a widely used technique for the estimation of subsurface parameters, such as permeability. However, the EnKF often fails to recover and preserve the channel structures
during the estimation process. Compressed Sensing (CS) has shown to significantly improve the reconstruction quality when dealing with such problems. We propose a new scheme based on
CS principles to enhance the reconstruction of subsurface geological features by transforming the EnKF estimation process to a sparse domain representing diverse geological structures.
Numerical experiments suggest that the proposed scheme provides an efficient mechanism to incorporate and preserve structural information in the estimation process and results in
significant enhancement in the recovery of flow channel structures.},

abstract={Hand gestures are tools for conveying information, expressing emotion, interacting with electronic devices or even serving disabled people as a second language. A gesture can
be recognized by capturing the movement of the hand, in real time, and classifying the collected data. Several commercial products such as Microsoft Kinect, Leap Motion Sensor,
Synertial Gloves and HTC Vive have been released and new solutions have been proposed by researchers to handle this task. These systems are mainly based on optical measurements,
inertial measurements, ultrasound signals and radio signals. This paper proposes an ultrasonic-based gesture recognition system using AOA (Angle of Arrival) information of ultrasonic
signals emitted from a wearable ultrasound transducer. The 2-D angles of the moving hand are estimated using multi-frequency signals captured by a fixed receiver array. A simple
redundant dictionary matching classifier is designed to recognize gestures representing the numbers from ‘0’ to ‘9’ and compared with a neural network classifier. Average
classification accuracies of 95.5% and 94.4% are obtained, respectively, using the two classification methods.},

abstract={The paper addresses the problem of channel estimation in Impulse-Radio Ultra-Wideband (IR-UWB) communication system. The IEEE 802.15.4a channel model is used where the
channel is assumed to be Linear Time Invariant (LTI) and thus the problem of channel estimation becomes the estimation of the sparse channel taps and their delays. Since, the bandwidth
of the signal is very large, Nyquist rate sampling is impractical, therefore, we propose to estimate the channel taps from the sub-sampled versions of the received signal profile. We
adopt the Bayesian framework to estimate the channel support by incorporating the a priori multipath arrival time statistics. In the first approach, we adopt a two-step method by
employing Compressive Sensing to obtain coarse estimates and then refine them by applying Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) criterion. In the second approach, we develop a Low-Complexity MAP
(LC-MAP) estimator. The computational complexity is reduced by identifying nearly orthogonal clusters in the received profile and by leveraging the structure of the sensing matrix.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider the problem of minimizing the maximum broadcast decoding delay experienced by all the receivers of generalized instantly decodable network coding
(IDNC). Unlike the sum decoding delay, the maximum decoding delay as a definition of delay for IDNC allows a more equitable distribution of the delays between the different receivers
and thus a better Quality of Service (QoS). In order to solve this problem, we first derive the expressions for the probability distributions of maximum decoding delay increments.
Given these expressions, we formulate the problem as a maximum weight clique problem in the IDNC graph. Although this problem is known to be NP-hard, we design a greedy algorithm to
perform effective packet selection. Through extensive simulations, we compare the sum decoding delay and the max decoding delay experienced when applying the policies to minimize the
sum decoding delay and our policy to reduce the max decoding delay. Simulations results show that our policy gives a good agreement among all the delay aspects in all situations and
outperforms the sum decoding delay policy to effectively minimize the sum decoding delay when the channel conditions become harsher. They also show that our definition of delay
significantly improve the number of served receivers when they are subject to strict delay constraints.},

abstract={Relay selection is a simple technique that achieves spatial diversity in cooperative relay networks. Nonetheless, relay selection algorithms generally require error-free
channel state information (CSI) from all cooperating relays. Practically, CSI acquisition generates a great deal of feedback overhead that could result in significant transmission
delays. In addition to this, the fed back channel information is usually corrupted by additive noise. This could lead to transmission outages if the central node selects the set of
cooperating relays based on inaccurate feedback information. In this paper, we propose a relay selection algorithm that tackles the above challenges. Instead of allocating each relay a
dedicated channel for feedback, all relays share a pool of feedback channels. Following that, each relay feeds back its identity only if its effective channel
(source-relay-destination) exceeds a threshold. After deriving closed-form expressions for the feedback load and the achievable rate, we show that the proposed algorithm drastically
reduces the feedback overhead and achieves a rate close to that obtained by selection algorithms with dedicated error-free feedback from all relays.},

abstract={Relay selection is a simple technique that achieves spatial diversity in cooperative relay networks. However, for relay selection algorithms to make a selection decision,
channel state information (CSI) from all cooperating relays is usually required at a central node. This requirement poses two important challenges. Firstly, CSI acquisition generates a
great deal of feedback overhead (air-time) that could result in significant transmission delays. Secondly, the fed back channel information is usually corrupted by additive noise. This
could lead to transmission outages if the central node selects the set of cooperating relays based on inaccurate feedback information. In this paper, we introduce a limited feedback
relay selection algorithm for a multicast relay network. The proposed algorithm exploits the theory of compressive sensing to first obtain the identity of the "strong" relays with
limited feedback. Following that, the CSI of the selected relays is estimated using linear minimum mean square error estimation. To minimize the effect of noise on the fed back CSI, we
introduce a back-off strategy that optimally backs-off on the noisy estimated CSI. For a fixed group size, we provide closed form expressions for the scaling law of the maximum
equivalent SNR for both Decode and Forward (DF) and Amplify and Forward (AF) cases. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm drastically reduces the feedback air-time and

year={2015},
volume={},

pages={1-6},
abstract={In the context of resource allocation in cloud- radio access networks, recent studies assume either signal-level or scheduling-level coordination. This paper, instead,
considers a hybrid level of coordination for the scheduling problem in the downlink of a multi-cloud radio- access network, so as to benefit from both scheduling policies. Consider a
multi-cloud radio access network, where each cloud is connected to several base-stations (BSs) via high capacity links, and therefore allows joint signal processing between them.
Across the multiple clouds, however, only scheduling-level coordination is permitted, as it requires a lower level of backhaul communication. The frame structure of every BS is
composed of various time/frequency blocks, called power- zones (PZs), and kept at fixed power level. The paper addresses the problem of maximizing a network-wide utility by associating
users to clouds and scheduling them to the PZs, under the practical constraints that each user is scheduled, at most, to a single cloud, but possibly to many BSs within the cloud, and
can be served by one or more distinct PZs within the BSs' frame. The paper solves the problem using graph theory techniques by constructing the conflict graph. The scheduling problem
is, then, shown to be equivalent to a maximum- weight independent set problem in the constructed graph, in which each vertex symbolizes an association of cloud, user, BS and PZ, with a
weight representing the utility of that association. Simulation results suggest that the proposed hybrid scheduling strategy provides appreciable gain as compared to the
scheduling-level coordinated networks, with a negligible degradation to signal-level coordination.},

abstract={Opportunistic schedulers rely on the feedback of all users in order to schedule a set of users with favorable channel conditions. While the downlink channels can be easily
estimated at all user terminals via a single broadcast, several key challenges are faced during uplink transmission. First of all, the statistics of the noisy and fading feedback
channels are unknown at the base station (BS) and channel training is usually required from all users. Secondly, the amount of network resources (air-time) required for feedback
transmission grows linearly with the number of users. In this paper, we tackle the above challenges and propose a Bayesian based scheduling algorithm that 1) reduces the air-time
required to identify the strong users, and 2) is agnostic to the statistics of the feedback channels and utilizes the a priori statistics of the additive noise to identify the strong
users. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm reduces the feedback air-time while improving detection in the presence of fading and noisy channels when compared to recent
compressed sensing based algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm achieves a sum-rate throughput close to that obtained by noiseless dedicated feedback systems.},

multi-cloud radio access network (CRAN) where each cloud is connected to several base-stations (BS) through limited-capacity wireline backhaul links. The set of BSs connected to each
cloud, called cluster, serves a set of pre-known mobile users (MUs). The performance of the system becomes therefore a function of both inter-cloud and intra-cloud interference, as
well as the compression schemes of the limited capacity backhaul links. The paper assumes independent compression scheme and imperfect channel state information (CSI) where the CSI
errors belong to an ellipsoidal bounded region. The problem of interest becomes the one of minimizing the network total transmit power subject to BS power and quality of service
constraints, as well as backhaul capacity and CSI error constraints. The paper suggests solving the problem using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). One of the
highlight of the paper is that the proposed ADMM-based algorithm can be implemented in a distributed fashion across the multi-cloud network by allowing a limited amount of information
exchange between the coupled clouds. Simulation results show that the proposed distributed algorithm provides a similar performance to the centralized algorithm in a reasonable number
of iterations.},

abstract={In this paper, we study the effect of lossy intermittent feedback loss events on the multicast decoding delay performance of generalized instantly decodable network coding.
These feedback loss events create uncertainty at the sender about the reception statues of different receivers and thus uncertainty to accurately determine subsequent instantly
decodable coded packets. To solve this problem, we first identify the different possibilities of uncertain packets at the sender and their probabilities. We then derive the expression
of the mean decoding delay. We formulate the Generalized Instantly Decodable Network Coding (G-IDNC) minimum decoding delay problem as a maximum weight clique problem. Since finding
the optimal solution is NP-hard, we design a variant of the algorithm employed in [1]. Our algorithm is compared to the two blind graph update proposed in [2] through extensive
simulations. Results show that our algorithm outperforms the blind approaches in all the situations and achieves a tolerable degradation, against the perfect feedback, for large
feedback loss period.},

abstract={For several years, the completion time and the decoding delay problems in Instantly Decodable Network Coding (IDNC) were considered separately and were thought to completely
act against each other. Recently, some works aimed to balance the effects of these two important IDNC metrics but none of them studied a further optimization of one by controlling the
other. In this paper, we study the effect of controlling the decoding delay to reduce the completion time below its currently best known solution. We first derive the
decoding-delay-dependent expressions of the users' and their overall completion times. Although using such expressions to find the optimal overall completion time is NP-hard, we use a
heuristic that minimizes the probability of increasing the maximum of these decoding-delay-dependent completion time expressions after each transmission through a layered control of
their decoding delays. Simulation results show that this new algorithm achieves both a lower mean completion time and mean decoding delay compared to the best known heuristic for
completion time reduction. The gap in performance becomes significant for harsh erasure scenarios.},

abstract={OFDM is a convenient vehicle for high rate transmission. However, this requires an accurate estimation of the channel at the receiver side. This paper proposes an
iterative/adaptive algorithm for semi-blind channel estimation. An initial channel estimate is obtained by relying on the artificial constraint of pilots. The algorithm subsequently
switches to the blind mode powered by the natural constraints imposed by the sparsity of the channel and the redundant and finite alphabet nature of the data. It iterates between using
the channel estimate to detect the data, and using the data estimate to further improve the channel estimate. The diagonal nature of the OFDM channel makes it possible to optimally
detect the data with low complexity. The complexity of the algorithm is further reduced by performing channel estimation adaptively. The simulation results demonstrate the favorable
behavior of the algorithm and the tradeoff that it provides between the number of pilots used and convergence speed.},

network transmission overhead, and 2) ensures the privacy of the load reports. Based on recent findings from [1] and [2], numerical results show that the proposed design significantly
reduces the network transmission overhead and utilizes the fading channel to encrypt the load reports, thus making it almost impossible for an eavesdropper to decipher the load

abstract={A key feature in the design of any MAC protocol is the throughput it can provide. In wireless networks, the channel of a user is not fixed but varies randomly. Thus, in order
to maximize the throughput of the MAC protocol at any given time, only users with large channel gains should be allowed to transmit. In this paper, a compressive sensing based
opportunistic protocol for exploiting multiuser diversity in wireless networks is proposed. This protocol is based on the traditional protocol of R-ALOHA which allows users to compete
for channel access before reserving the channel to the best user. We use compressive sensing to find the best user, and show that the proposed protocol requires less time for
reservation and so it outperforms other schemes proposed in the literature. Also, as the proposed scheme requires less reservation time, it can be seen as an enhancement for R-ALOHA
schemes in fast fading environment.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider blind data detection for OFDM transmission over block fading channels. Specifically, we show how constant modulus data of an OFDM symbol can be
blindly detected using output symbol and associated cyclic prefix. Our approach relies on decomposing the OFDM channel into two subchannels (cyclic and linear) that share the same
input and are characterized by the same channel parameters. This fact enables us to estimate the channel parameters from one subchannel and substitute the estimate into the other, thus
obtaining a nonlinear relationship involving the input and output data only that can be searched for the maximum likelihood estimate of the input. This shows that OFDM systems are
completely identifiable using output data only, irrespective of the channel zeros, as long as the channel delay spread is less than the length of the cyclic prefix. We also propose
iterative methods to reduce the computational complexity involved in the maximum likelihood search of input.},

abstract={This paper considers the problem of reducing the broadcast delay of wireless networks using instantly decodable network coding (IDNC) based device-to-device (D2D)
communications. In D2D-enabled networks, devices help hasten the recovery of the lost packets of devices in their transmission range by sending network coded packets. To solve the
problem, the different events occurring at each device are identified so as to derive an expression for the probability distribution of the decoding delay. The joint optimization
problem over the set of transmitting devices and the packet combinations of each is formulated. Due to the high complexity of finding the optimal solution, this paper focuses on
cooperation without interference between the transmitting users. The optimal solution, in such interference-less scenario, is expressed using a graph theory approach by introducing the
cooperation graph. Extensive simulations compare the decoding delay experienced in the Point to Multi-Point (PMP), the fully connected D2D (FC-D2D) and the more practical partially
connected D2D (PC-D2D) configurations and suggest that the PC-D2D outperforms the FC-D2D in all situations and provides an enormous gain for poorly connected networks.},

abstract={The radiation pattern of an antenna array depends on the excitation weights and the geometry of the array. Due to mobility, some vehicular antenna elements might be subjected
to full or partial blockages from a plethora of particles like dirt, salt, ice, and water droplets. These particles cause absorption and scattering to the signal incident on the array,
and as a result, change the array geometry. This distorts the radiation pattern of the array mostly with an increase in the sidelobe level and decrease in gain. In this paper, we
propose a blockage detection technique for millimeter wave vehicular antenna arrays that jointly estimates the locations of the blocked antennas and the attenuation and phase-shifts
that result from the suspended particles. The proposed technique does not require the antenna array to be physically removed from the vehicle and permits real-time array diagnosis.
Numerical results show that the proposed technique provides satisfactory results in terms of block detection with low detection time provided that the number of blockages is small
compared to the array size.},

abstract={In this paper, as an extension to [1], we propose a prioritized multi-layer network coding scheme for collaborative packet recovery in hybrid (interweave and underlay)
cellular cognitive radio networks. This scheme allows the uncoordinated collaboration between the collocated primary and cognitive radio base-stations in order to minimize their own as
well as each other's packet recovery overheads, thus by improving their throughput. The proposed scheme ensures that each network's performance is not degraded by its help to the other
network. Moreover, it guarantees that the primary network's interference threshold is not violated in the same and adjacent cells. Yet, the scheme allows the reduction of the recovery
overhead in the collocated primary and cognitive radio networks. The reduction in the cognitive radio network is further amplified due to the perfect detection of spectrum holes which
allows the cognitive radio base station to transmit at higher power without fear of violating the interference threshold of the primary network. For the secondary network, simulation
results show reductions of 20% and 34% in the packet recovery overhead, compared to the non-collaborative scheme, for low and high probabilities of primary packet arrivals,
respectively. For the primary network, this reduction was found to be 12%.},

abstract={The main limitation of deploying/updating Received Signal Strength (RSS) based indoor localization is the construction of fingerprinted radio map, which is quite a hectic and
time-consuming process especially when the indoor area is enormous and/or dynamic. Different approaches have been undertaken to reduce such deployment/update efforts, but the
performance degrades when the fingerprinting load is reduced below a certain level. In this paper, we propose an indoor localization scheme that requires as low as 1% fingerprinting
load. This scheme employs unsupervised manifold alignment that takes crowd sourced RSS readings and localization requests as source data set and the environment's plan coordinates as
destination data set. The 1% fingerprinting load is only used to perturb the local geometries in the destination data set. Our proposed algorithm was shown to achieve less than 5 m
mean localization error with 1% fingerprinting load and a limited number of crowd sourced readings, when other learning based localization schemes pass the 10 m mean error with the
same information.},

recent advances in reconstruction of sparse signals from rank-deficient projections using convex programming collectively known as compressive sensing. Since previous work in the
literature has focused on using the reserved tones as spectral support for optimum peak-reducing signals in the time-domain, the complexity at the transmitter was always a problem. In
this work, we alternatively use extremely simple peak-reducing signals at the transmitter, then use the reserved tones to detect the peak-reducing signal at the receiver by a convex
relaxation of an other-wise combinatorially prohibitive optimization problem. This in effect completely shifts the complexity to the receiver and drastically reduces it from a function
of N (the number of subcarriers in the OFDM signal), to a function of m (the number of reserved tones) which is a small subset of N.},

family and the least-mean mixed-norm algorithm. Specifically, it is shown that the LMS algorithm and its error-modified variants are approximations of two previously developed optimum
nonlinearities which are expressed in terms of the additive noise probability density function (PDF). This is demonstrated through an approximation of the optimum nonlinearities by
expanding the noise PDF in a Gram-Charlier series. Thus a link is established between intuitively proposed and theoretically justified variants of the LMS algorithm. The approximation
has also a practical advantage in that it provides a trade-off between simplicity and more accurate realization of the optimum nonlinearities},

abstract={In this paper we introduce a self interference (SI) estimation and minimisation technique for amplify and forward relays. Relays are used to help forward signals between a
transmitter and a receiver. This helps increase the signal coverage and reduce the required transmitted signal power. One problem that faces relays communications is the leaked signal
from the relay's output to its input. This will cause an SI problem where the new received signal at the relay's input will be added with the unwanted leaked signal from the relay's
output. A Solution is proposed in this paper to estimate and minimise this SI which is based upon using a tapped filter at the destination. To get the optimum weights for this tapped
filter, some channel parameters must be estimated first. This is performed blindly at the destination without the need of any training. This channel parameter estimation method is
named the blind-self-interference-channel-estimation (BSICE) method. The next step in the proposed solution is to estimate the tapped filter's weights. This is performed by minimising
the mean squared error (MSE) at the destination. This proposed method is named the MSE-Optimum Weight (MSE-OW) method. Simulation results are provided in this paper to verify the
performance of BSICE and MSE-OW methods.},

abstract={In multiple-input multiple-output radar systems, it is usually desirable to steer transmitted power in the region-of-interest. To do this, conventional methods optimize the
waveform covariance matrix,R, for the desired beampattern, which is then used to generate actual transmitted waveforms. In this paper, we provide a low complexity closed-form solution
to design covariance matrix for the given planar beampattern using the planar array, which is then used to derive a novel closedform algorithm to directly design the finite-alphabet
constantenvelope waveforms. The proposed algorithm exploits the two-dimensional fast-Fourier-transform. The performance of our proposed algorithm is compared with the existing methods
that are based on semi-definite quadratic programming with the advantage of a considerably reduced complexity.},

abstract={The cloud-radio access network (CRAN) is expected to be the core network architecture for next generation mobile radio systems. In this paper, we consider the downlink of a
CRAN formed of one central processor (the cloud) and several base station (BS), where each BS is connected to the cloud via either a wireless or capacity-limited wireline backhaul
link. The paper addresses the joint design of the hybrid backhaul links (i.e., designing the wireline and wireless backhaul connections from the cloud to the BSs) and the access links
(i.e., determining the sparse beamforming solution from the BSs to the users). The paper formulates the hybrid backhaul and access link design problem by minimizing the total network
power consumption. The paper solves the problem using a two-stage heuristic algorithm. At one stage, the sparse beamforming solution is found using a weighted mixed 11/12 norm
minimization approach; the correlation matrix of the quantization noise of the wireline backhaul links is computed using the classical rate-distortion theory. At the second stage, the
transmit powers of the wireless backhaul links are found by solving a power minimization problem subject to quality-of-service constraints, based on the principle of conservation of
rate by utilizing the rates found in the first stage. Simulation results suggest that the performance of the proposed algorithm approaches the global optimum solution, especially at
high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR).},

error (MMSE) estimation for estimating the impulse amplitudes. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves higher rate as compared to other known sparse estimation

abstract={OFDM combines the advantages of high achievable rates and relatively easy implementation. However, for proper recovery of the input, the OFDM receiver needs accurate channel

communication problem-a structure induced by the data and channel constraints. These constraints include pilots, the cyclic prefix, and the finite alphabet constraints on the data, and
sparsity, finite delay spread, and the statistical properties of the channel (frequency and time correlation). The algorithm boils down to a forward-backward (FB) Kalman filter. We
also suggest a suboptimal modification that is able to track the channel and recover the data with no latency.},

abstract={The advent of smartphones and tablets over the past several years has resulted in a drastic increase of global carbon footprint, due to the explosive growth of data traffic.
Improving energy efficiency (EE) becomes, therefore, a crucial design metric in next generation wireless systems (5G). Cloud radio access network (C-RAN), a promising 5G network
architecture, provides an efficient framework for improving the EE performance, by means of coordinating the transmission across the network. This paper considers a C-RAN system formed
by several clusters of remote radio heads (RRHs), each serving a predetermined set of mobile users (MUs), and assumes imperfect channel state information (CSI). The network performance
becomes therefore a function of the intra-cluster and inter-cluster interference, as well as the channel estimation error. The paper optimizes the transmit power of each RRH in order
to maximize the network global EE subject to MU service rate requirements and RRHs maximum power constraints. The paper proposes solving the optimization problem using a heuristic
algorithm based on techniques from optimization theory via a two-stage iterative solution. Simulation results show that the proposed power allocation algorithm provides an appreciable
performance improvement as compared to the conventional systems with maximum power transmission strategy. They further highlight the convergence of the proposed algorithm for different
networks scenarios.},

1}n to ℝn and the box constrained case where the relaxation is to [-1, 1]n. For both cases, we derive an exact expression of the bit error probability when n and m grow simultaneously
large at a fixed ratio. For the box constrained case, we show that there exists a critical value of the SNR, above which the optimal regularizer is zero. On the other side, the
regularization can further improve the performance of the box relaxation at low to moderate SNR regimes. We also prove that the optimal regularizer in the bit error rate sense for the
unboxed case is nothing but the MMSE detector.},

pages={484-488},
abstract={This paper proposes a low-sampling-rate scheme for ultra-wideband channel estimation. In the proposed scheme, P pulses are transmitted to produce P observations. These
observations are exploited to produce channel impulse response estimates at a desired sampling rate, while the ADC operates at a rate that is P times less. To avoid loss of fidelity,
the interpulse interval, given in units of sampling periods of the desired rate, is restricted to be co-prime with P. This condition is affected when clock drift is present and the
transmitted pulse locations change. To handle this situation and to achieve good performance without using prior information, we derive an improved estimator based on the bounded data
uncertainty (BDU) model. This estimator is shown to be related to the Bayesian linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimator. The performance of the proposed sub-sampling scheme
was tested in conjunction with the new estimator. It is shown that high reduction in sampling rate can be achieved. The proposed estimator outperforms the least squares estimator in
most cases; while in the high SNR regime, it also outperforms the LMMSE estimator.},

abstract={Several research efforts are invested to develop stochastic geometry models for cellular networks with multiple antenna transmission and reception (MIMO). On one hand, there
are models that target abstract outage probability and ergodic rate for simplicity. On the other hand, there are models that sacrifice simplicity to target more tangible performance
metrics such as the error probability. Both types of models are completely disjoint in terms of the analytic steps to obtain the performance measures, which makes it challenging to
conduct studies that account for different performance metrics. This paper unifies both techniques and proposes a unified stochastic-geometry based mathematical paradigm to account for
error probability, outage probability, and ergodic rates in MIMO cellular networks. The proposed model is also unified in terms of the antenna configurations and leads to simpler error
probability analysis compared to existing state-of-the-art models. The core part of the analysis is based on abstracting unnecessary information conveyed within the interfering signals
by assuming Gaussian signaling. To this end, the accuracy of the proposed framework is verified against state-of-the-art models as well as system level simulations. We provide via this
unified study insights on network design by reflecting system parameters effect on different performance metrics.},

abstract={We propose a distributed user selection strategy in a network MIMO setting with M base stations serving K users. Each base station is equipped with L antennas, where LM ≪ K.
The conventional selection strategy is based on a well known technique called semi-orthogonal user selection when the zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) is adopted. Such technique,
however, requires perfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), which might not be available or need large feedback overhead. This paper proposes an alternative
distributed user selection technique where each user sets a timer that is inversely proportional to his channel quality indicator (CQI), as a means to reduce the feedback overhead. The
proposed strategy allows only the user with the highest CQI to respond with a feedback. Such technique, however, remains collision free only if the transmission time is shorter than
the difference between the strongest user timer and the second strongest user timer. To overcome the situation of longer transmission times, the paper proposes another feedback
strategy that is based on the theory of compressive sensing, where collision is allowed and all users encode their feedback information and send it back to the base-stations
simultaneously. The paper shows that the problem can be formulated as a block sparse recovery problem which is agnostic on the transmission time, which makes it a good alternative to
the timer approach when collision is dominant.},
