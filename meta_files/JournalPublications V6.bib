abstract={This paper addresses the problem of selecting the regularization parameter for linear least-squares estimation. We propose a new technique called bounded perturbation regularization (BPR). In the proposed BPR method, a perturbation with a bounded norm is allowed into the linear transformation matrix to improve the singular-value structure. Following this, the problem is formulated as a min–max optimization problem. Next, the min–max problem is converted to an equivalent minimization problem to estimate the unknown vector quantity. The solution of the minimization problem is shown to converge to that of the $ell _{2}$ -regularized least squares problem, with the unknown regularizer related to the norm bound of the introduced perturbation through a nonlinear constraint. A procedure is proposed that combines the constraint equation with the mean squared error criterion to develop an approximately optimal regularization parameter selection algorithm. Both direct and indirect applications of the proposed method are considered. Comparisons with different Tikhonov regularization parameter selection methods, as well as with other relevant methods, are carried out. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method provides significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of blind demixing of instantaneous mixtures in a multiple-input multiple-output communication system. The main objective is to present efficient blind source separation (BSS) algorithms dedicated to moderate or high-order QAM constellations. Four new iterative batch BSS algorithms are presented dealing with the multimodulus (MM) and alphabet matched (AM) criteria. For the optimization of these cost functions, iterative methods of Givens and hyperbolic rotations are used. A pre-whitening operation is also utilized to reduce the complexity of design problem. It is noticed that the designed algorithms using Givens rotations gives satisfactory performance only for large number of samples. However, for small number of samples, the algorithms designed by combining both Givens and hyperbolic rotations compensate for the ill-whitening that occurs in this case and thus improves the performance. Two algorithms dealing with the MM criterion are presented for moderate order QAM signals such as 16-QAM. The other two dealing with the AM criterion are presented for high-order QAM signals. These methods are finally compared with the state of art batch BSS algorithms in terms of signal-to-interference and noise ratio, symbol error rate and convergence rate. Simulation results show that the proposed methods outperform the contemporary batch BSS algorithms.},

abstract={The radiation pattern of an antenna array depends on the excitation weights and the geometry of the array. Due to wind and atmospheric conditions, outdoor millimeter wave antenna elements are subject to full or partial blockages from a plethora of particles like dirt, salt, ice, and water droplets. Handheld devices are also subject to blockages from random finger placement and/or finger prints. These blockages cause absorption and scattering to the signal incident on the array, modify the array geometry, and distort the far-field radiation pattern of the array. This paper studies the effects of blockages on the far-field radiation pattern of linear arrays and proposes several array diagnosis techniques for millimeter wave antenna arrays. The proposed techniques jointly estimate the locations of the blocked antennas and the induced attenuation and phase-shifts given knowledge of the angles of arrival/departure. Numerical results show that the proposed techniques provide satisfactory results in terms of fault detection with reduced number of measurements (diagnosis time) provided that the number of blockages is small compared to the array size.},

abstract= {Abstract This paper analyzes the statistical properties of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the output of the Capon's minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformers when operating over impulsive noises. Particularly, we consider the supervised case in which the receiver employs the regularized Tyler estimator in order to estimate the covariance matrix of the interference-plus-noise process using n observations of size N×1. The choice for the regularized Tyler estimator (RTE) is motivated by its resilience to the presence of outliers and its regularization parameter that guarantees a good conditioning of the covariance estimate. Of particular interest in this paper is the derivation of the second order statistics of the SINR. To achieve this goal, we consider two different approaches. The first one is based on considering the classical regime, referred to as the n-large regime, in which N is assumed to be fixed while n grows to infinity. The second approach is built upon recent results developed within the framework of random matrix theory and assumes that N and n grow large together. Numerical results are provided in order to compare between the accuracies of each regime under different settings.}

abstract= {Abstract The least-mean-fourth (LMF) algorithm is known for its fast convergence and lower steady state error, especially in sub-Gaussian noise environments. Recent work on normalised versions of the LMF algorithm has further enhanced its stability and performance in both Gaussian and sub-Gaussian noise environments. For example, the recently developed normalised LMF (XE-NLMF) algorithm is normalised by the mixed signal and error powers, and weighted by a fixed mixed-power parameter. Unfortunately, this algorithm depends on the selection of this mixing parameter. In this work, a time-varying mixed-power parameter technique is introduced to overcome this dependency. A convergence analysis, transient analysis, and steady-state behaviour of the proposed algorithm are derived and verified through simulations. An enhancement in performance is obtained through the use of this technique in two different scenarios. Moreover, the tracking analysis of the proposed algorithm is carried out in the presence of two sources of nonstationarities: (1) carrier frequency offset between transmitter and receiver and (2) random variations in the environment. Close agreement between analysis and simulation results is obtained. The results show that, unlike in the stationary case, the steady-state excess mean-square error is not a monotonically increasing function of the step size.}

We exploit these constraints to derive a frequency domain maximum a posteriori (MAP) channel estimator. Furthermore, we develop a data aided (expectation maximization based) estimator incorporating frequency correlation information. The estimator is further enhanced by utilizing the time correlation information through a forward backward (FB) Kalman filter. We also explore various implementation for the FB Kalman filter.

The nonlinear distortion is considered as a sparse phenomenon in the time-domain, and three compressed sensing based algorithms are presented to estimate and compensate for these distortions at the receiver using a few and, at times, even no frequency-domain free carriers (i.e. pilot carriers). The first technique is a conventional compressed sensing approach, while the second incorporates a priori information about the distortions to enhance the estimation. Finally, the third technique involves an iterative data-aided algorithm that does not require any pilot carriers and hence allows the system to work at maximum bandwidth efficiency. The performances of all the proposed techniques are evaluated on a commercial power amplifier and compared. The error vector magnitude and symbol error rate results show the ability of compressed sensing to compensate for the amplifier's nonlinear distortions.},

abstract={This paper investigates the joint maximum likelihood (ML) data detection and channel estimation problem for Alamouti space-time block-coded (STBC) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) wireless systems. The joint ML estimation and data detection is generally considered a hard combinatorial optimization problem. We propose an efficient low-complexity algorithm based on branch-estimate-bound strategy that renders exact joint ML solution. However, the computational complexity of blind algorithm becomes critical at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the number of OFDM carriers and constellation size are increased especially in multiple-antenna systems. To overcome this problem, a semi-blind algorithm based on a new framework for reducing the complexity is proposed by relying on subcarrier reordering and decoding the carriers with different levels of confidence using a suitable reliability criterion. In addition, it is shown that by utilizing the inherent structure of Alamouti coding, the estimation performance improvement or the complexity reduction can be achieved. The proposed algorithms can reliably track the wireless Rayleigh fading channel without requiring any channel statistics. Simulation results presented against the perfect coherent detection demonstrate the effectiveness of blind and semi-blind algorithms over frequency-selective channels with different fading characteristics.},

The proposed method finds the time delay from the room impulse response (RIR) which makes it robust against room reverberations. We consider the RIR as a sparse phenomenon and apply a recently proposed sparse signal reconstruction technique called orthogonal clustering (OC) for its estimation from the sub-sampled received signal. The arrival time of the direct path signal at a pair of microphones is identified from the estimated RIR, and their difference yields the desired time delay estimate (TDE). Low sampling rates reduces the hardware and computational complexity and decreases the communication between the microphones and the centralized location. Simulation and experimental results of an actual hardware setup are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed technique.},

abstract={This paper studies the delay reduction problem for instantly decodable network coding (IDNC)-based device-to-device (D2D) communication-enabled networks. Unlike conventional point-to-multipoint (PMP) systems in which the wireless base station has the sufficient computation abilities, D2D networks rely on battery-powered operations of the devices. Therefore, a particular emphasis on the computation complexity needs to be addressed in the design of delay reduction algorithms for D2D networks. While most of the existing literature on IDNC directly extend the delay reduction PMP schemes, known to be NP-hard, to the D2D setting, this paper proposes to investigate and minimize the complexity of such algorithms for battery-powered devices. With delay minimization problems in IDNC-based systems being equivalent to a maximum weight clique problems in the IDNC graph, the presented algorithms, in this paper, can be applied to different delay aspects. This paper introduces and focuses on the reduction of the maximum value of the decoding delay as it represents the most general solution. The complexity of the solution is reduced by first proposing efficient methods for the construction, the update, and the dimension reduction of the IDNC graph. The paper, further, shows that, under particular scenarios, the problem boils down to a maximum clique problem. Due to the complexity of discovering such maximum clique, the paper presents a fast selection algorithm. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed schemes and suggest that the proposed fast selection algorithm provides appreciable complexity gain as compared to the optimal selection one, with a negligible degradation in performance. In addition, they indicate that the running time of the proposed solution is close to the random selection algorithm.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Strong light-matter coupling has been recently successfully explored in the GHz and THz [1] range with on-chip platforms. New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength $\Omega$ becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system $\omega$. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large $\Omega$/$\omega$c=0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling $\Omega$ ∝ √n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom. We now engineer a new cavity, resonant at 290 GHz, with an extremely reduced effective mode surface Seff=4 × 10-14 m2 (FE simulations, CST), yielding large field enhancements above 1500 and allowing to enter the few ({\textless};100) electron regime. It consist of a complementary metasurface with two very sharp metallic tips separated by a 60 nm gap (Fig.1(a, b)) on top of a single triangular quantum well. THz-TDS transmission experiments as a function of the applied magnetic field reveal strong anticrossing of the cavity mode with linear cyclotron dispersion. Measurements for arrays of only 12 cavities are reported in Fig.1(c). On the top horizontal axis we report the number of electrons occupying the topmost Landau level as a function of the magnetic field. At the anticrossing field of B=0.73 T we measure approximately 60 electrons ultra strongly coupled ($\Omega$/$\omega$- ||},

abstract={By virtue of large antenna arrays, massive MIMO systems have a potential to yield higher spectral and energy efficiency in comparison with the conventional MIMO systems. This 
paper addresses uplink channel estimation in massive MIMO-OFDM systems with frequency selective channels. We propose an efficient distributed minimum mean square error (MMSE) algorithm 
that can achieve near optimal channel estimates at low complexity by exploiting the strong spatial correlation among antenna array elements. The proposed method involves solving a 
reduced dimensional MMSE problem at each antenna followed by a repetitive sharing of information through collaboration among neighboring array elements. To further enhance the channel 
estimates and/or reduce the number of reserved pilot tones, we propose a data-aided estimation technique that relies on finding a set of most reliable data carriers. Furthermore, we 
use stochastic geometry to quantify the pilot contamination, and in turn use this information to analyze the effect of pilot contamination on channel MSE. The simulation results 
validate our analysis and show near optimal performance of the proposed estimation algorithms.},

pages={5956-5970},
abstract={This paper considers the multicast decoding delay reduction problem for generalized instantly decodable network coding (G-IDNC) over persistent erasure channels with feedback 
imperfections. The feedback scenario discussed is the most general situation in which the sender does not always receive acknowledgments from the receivers after each transmission and 
the feedback communications are subject to loss. The decoding delay increment expressions are derived and employed to express the decoding delay reduction problem as a maximum weight 
clique problem in the G-IDNC graph. This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the expected decoding delay increase at each time instant. Problem formulations in simpler channel and 
feedback models are shown to be special cases of the proposed generalized formulation. Since finding the optimal solution to the problem is known to be NP-hard, a suboptimal greedy 
algorithm is designed and compared with blind approaches proposed in the literature. Through extensive simulations, the proposed algorithm is shown to outperform the blind methods in 
all situations and to achieve significant improvement, particularly for high time-correlated channels.},

pages={1851-1867},
abstract={While network densification is considered an important solution to cater the ever-increasing capacity demand, its effect on the handover (HO) rate is overlooked. In dense 5G 
networks, HO delays may neutralize or even negate the gains offered by network densification. Hence, user mobility imposes a nontrivial challenge to harvest capacity gains via network 
densification. In this paper, we propose a velocity-aware HO management scheme for two-tier downlink cellular network to mitigate the HO effect on the foreseen densification throughput 
gains. The proposed HO scheme sacrifices the best base station (BS) connectivity, by skipping HO to some BSs along the user trajectory, to maintain longer connection durations and 
reduce HO rates. Furthermore, the proposed scheme enables cooperative BS service and strongest interference cancellation to compensate for skipping the best connectivity. To this end, 
we consider different HO skipping scenarios and develop a velocity-aware mathematical model, via stochastic geometry, to quantify the performance of the proposed HO schemes in terms of 
the coverage probability and user throughput. The results highlight the HO rate problem in dense cellular environments and show the importance of the proposed HO schemes. Finally, the 
value of BS cooperation along with handover skipping is quantified for different user mobility profiles.},

title={Resource allocation in heterogeneous cloud radio access networks: advances and challenges},
year={2015},
volume={22},
number={3},
pages={66-73},
abstract={Base station densification is increasingly used by network operators to provide better throughput and coverage performance to mobile subscribers in dense data traffic areas. 
Such densification is progressively diffusing the move from traditional macrocell base stations toward heterogeneous networks with diverse cell sizes (e.g., microcell, picocell, 
femotcell) and diverse radio access technologies (e.g., GSM, CDMA), and LTE). The coexistence of the different network entities brings an additional set of challenges, particularly in 
terms of the provisioning of high-speed communications and the management of wireless interference. Resource sharing between different entities, largely incompatible in conventional 
systems due to the lack of interconnections, becomes a necessity. By connecting all the base stations from different tiers to a central processor (referred to as the cloud) through 
wire/wireline backhaul links, the heterogeneous cloud radio access network, H-CRAN, provides an open, simple, controllable, and flexible paradigm for resource allocation. This article 
discusses challenges and recent developments in H-CRAN design. It proposes promising resource allocation schemes in H-CRAN: coordinated scheduling, hybrid backhauling, and multicloud 
association. Simulations results show how the proposed strategies provide appreciable performance improvement compared to methods from recent literature.},

abstract={This letter presents a novel approach for evaluating the mean behavior of the well known normalized least mean squares (NLMS) adaptive algorithm for a circularly correlated

abstract={It has been shown recently that dirty paper coding (DPC) achieves optimum sum-rate capacity in a multi-antenna broadcast channel with full channel state (CSI) information at

RBF incurs an SNR hit as compared to DPC. In this letter, we explore precoding techniques to reduce the effect of correlation on RBF. We thus derive the optimum precoding matrix that

abstract={Cellular networks have preserved an application agnostic and base station (BS) centric architecture1 for decades. Network functionalities (e.g. user association) are decided

achieving the ambitious metrics of next generation cellular systems. This article first highlights the features and drawbacks of such architectural ossification. Then the article 
proposes a virtualized and cognitive network architecture, wherein network functionalities are implemented via software instances in the cloud, and the underlying architecture can 
adapt to the application of interest as well as to changes in channels and traffic conditions. The adaptation is done in terms of the network topology by manipulating connectivities 
and steering traffic via different paths, so as to attain the applications' requirements and network design objectives. The article presents cognitive strategies to implement some of 
the classical network functionalities, along with their related implementation challenges. The article further presents a case study illustrating the performance improvement of the 
proposed architecture as compared to conventional cellular networks, both in terms of outage probability and handover rate.},

title={Opportunistic Relay Selection With Limited Feedback},
year={2015},
volume={63},
number={8},
pages={2885-2898},
abstract={Relay selection is a simple technique that achieves spatial diversity in cooperative relay networks. Generally, relay selection algorithms require channel state information 
(CSI) feedback from all cooperating relays to make a selection decision. This requirement poses two important challenges, which are often neglected in the literature. Firstly, the fed 
back channel information is usually corrupted by additive noise. Secondly, CSI feedback generates a great deal of feedback overhead (air-time) that could result in significant 
performance hits. In this paper, we propose a compressive sensing (CS) based relay selection algorithm that reduces the feedback overhead of relay networks under the assumption of 
noisy feedback channels. The proposed algorithm exploits CS to first obtain the identity of a set of relays with favorable channel conditions. Following that, the CSI of the identified 
relays is estimated using least squares estimation without any additional feedback. Both single and multiple relay selection cases are considered. After deriving closed-form 
expressions for the asymptotic end-to-end SNR at the destination and the feedback load for different relaying protocols, we show that CS-based selection drastically reduces the 
feedback load and achieves a rate close to that obtained by selection algorithms with dedicated error-free feedback.},

pages={2298-2301},
abstract={In practical wireless systems, the successful implementation of resource allocation techniques strongly depends on the algorithmic complexity. Consider a cloud-radio access 
network (CRAN), where the central cloud is responsible for scheduling devices to the frames' radio resources blocks (RRBs) of the single-antenna base-stations (BSs), adjusting the 
transmit power levels, and for synchronizing the transmit frames across the connected BSs. Previous studies show that the jointly coordinated scheduling and power control problem in 
the considered CRAN can be solved using an approach that scales exponentially with the number of BSs, devices, and RRBs, which makes the practical implementation infeasible for 
reasonably sized networks. This letter instead proposes a low-complexity solution to the problem, under the constraints that each device cannot be served by more than one BS but can be 
served by multiple RRBs within each BS frame, and under the practical assumption that the channel is constant during the duration of each frame. The paper utilizes graph-theoretical 
based techniques and shows that constructing a single power control graph is sufficient to obtain the optimal solution with a complexity that is independent of the number of RRBs. 
Simulation results reveal the optimality of the proposed solution for slow-varying channels, and show that the solution performs near-optimal for highly correlated channels.},

pages={9073-9081},
abstract={Network densification is foreseen as a potential solution to fulfill the 5G spectral efficiency requirements. The spectral efficiency is improved by shrinking base stations' 
(BSs) footprints, thus improving the spatial frequency reuse and reducing the number of users sharing the resources of each BS. However, the foreseen densification gains are achieved 
at the expense of increasing handover (HO) rates. Hence, HO rate is a key performance limiting factor that should be carefully considered in densification planning. This paper sheds 
light on the HO problem that appears in dense 5G networks and proposes an effective solution via topology aware HO skipping. Different skipping techniques are considered and compared 
with the conventional best connected scheme. To this end, the proposed schemes are validated via the average user rate in downlink single-tier and two-tier cellular networks, which are 
modeled using the Poisson point process and the Poisson cluster process, respectively. The proposed skipping schemes show up to 47% gains in the average throughput, which would 
maximize the benefit of network densification.},

abstract={In this work, we propose a unified approach to evaluating the CDF and PDF of indefinite quadratic forms in Gaussian random variables. Such a quantity appears in many
applications in communications, signal processing, information theory, and adaptive filtering. For example, this quantity appears in the mean-square-error (MSE) analysis of the
normalized least-mean-square (NLMS) adaptive algorithm, and SINR associated with each beam in beam forming applications. The trick of the proposed approach is to replace inequalities
that appear in the CDF calculation with unit step functions and to use complex integral representation of the the unit step function. Complex integration allows us then to evaluate the
CDF in closed form for the zero mean case and as a single dimensional integral for the non-zero mean case. Utilizing the saddle point technique allows us to closely approximate such
integrals in non zero mean case. We demonstrate how our approach can be extended to other scenarios such as the joint distribution of quadratic forms and ratios of such forms, and to
characterize quadratic forms in isotropic distributed random variables. We also evaluate the outage probability in multiuser beamforming using our approach to provide an application of
indefinite forms in communications.},

pages={4871-4883},
abstract={In this paper, we study the multicast completion and decoding delay minimization problems for instantly decodable network coding (IDNC) in the case of lossy feedback. When
feedback loss events occur, the sender falls into uncertainties about packet reception at the different receivers, which forces it to perform partially blind selections of packet
combinations in subsequent transmissions. To determine efficient selection policies that reduce the completion and decoding delays of IDNC in such an environment, we first extend the
perfect feedback formulation in our previous works to the lossy feedback environment, by incorporating the uncertainties resulting from unheard feedback events in these formulations.
For the completion delay problem, we use this formulation to identify the maximum likelihood state of the network in events of unheard feedback and employ it to design a partially
blind graph update extension to the multicast IDNC algorithm in our earlier work. For the decoding delay problem, we derive an expression for the expected decoding delay increment for
any arbitrary transmission. This expression is then used to find the optimal policy that reduces the decoding delay in such lossy feedback environment. Results show that our proposed
solutions both outperform previously proposed approaches and achieve tolerable degradation even at relatively high feedback loss rates.},

abstract={This paper presents exact mean-square analysis of the -NLMS algorithm for circular complex correlated Gaussian input. The analysis is based on the derivation of a closed form
expression for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of random variables of the form ∥ui∥D12/(ϵ + ∥ui∥D12) and using that to derive the first and second moments of such variables.
These moments in turn completely characterize the mean square (MS) behavior of the ϵ-NLMS in explicit closed form expressions. Both transient and steady-state behavior are analyzed.
Consequently, new explicit closed-form expressions for the mean-square-error (MSE) behavior are derived. Our simulations of the transient and steady-state behavior of the filter match
the expressions obtained theoretically for various degrees of input correlation and for various values of ϵ.},

abstract={Millimeter wave (mmWave) vehicular communication systems will provide an abundance of bandwidth for the exchange of raw sensor data and support driver-assisted and
safety-related functionalities. Lack of secure communication links, however, may lead to abuses and attacks that jeopardize the efficiency of transportation systems and the physical
safety of drivers. In this paper, we propose two physical layer (PHY) security techniques for vehicular mmWave communication systems. The first technique uses multiple antennas with a
single radio-frequency (RF) chain to transmit information symbols to a target receiver and noise-like signals in nonreceiver directions. The second technique uses multiple antennas
with a few RF chains to transmit information symbols to a target receiver and opportunistically inject artificial noise in controlled directions, thereby reducing interference in
vehicular environments. Theoretical and numerical results show that the proposed techniques provide higher secrecy rate when compared to traditional PHY security techniques that
require digital or more complex antenna architectures.},

paper proposes solving the problem using the alternating direction method of multipliers, which leads to a distributed implementation through limited information exchange across the
coupled secondary transmitters. This paper additionally proposes a solution that guarantees feasibility at each iteration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution

pages={4922-4935},
abstract={This paper addresses the design of adaptive subspace matched filter (ASMF) detectors in the presence of a mismatch in the steering vector. These detectors are coined as
adaptive in reference to the step of utilizing an estimate of the clutter covariance matrix using training data of signal-free observations. To estimate the clutter covariance matrix,
we employ regularized covariance estimators that, by construction, force the eigenvalues of the covariance estimates to be greater than a positive scalar ρ. While this feature is
likely to increase the bias of the covariance estimate, it presents the advantage of improving its conditioning, thus making the regularization suitable for handling high-dimensional
regimes. In this paper, we consider the setting of the regularization parameter and the threshold for ASMF detectors in both Gaussian and compound Gaussian clutters. In order to allow
for a proper selection of these parameters, it is essential to analyze the false alarm and detection probabilities. For tractability, such a task is carried out under the asymptotic
regime in which the number of observations and their dimensions grow simultaneously large, thereby allowing us to leverage existing results from random matrix theory. Simulation
results are provided in order to illustrate the relevance of the proposed design strategy and to compare the performances of the proposed ASMF detectors versus adaptive normalized

abstract={Estimating the locations and the structures of subsurface channels holds significant importance for forecasting the subsurface flow and reservoir productivity. These channels
exhibit high permeability and are easily contrasted from the low-permeability rock formations in their surroundings. This enables formulating the flow channels estimation problem as a
sparse field recovery problem. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a widely used technique for the estimation and calibration of subsurface reservoir model parameters, such as
permeability. However, the conventional EnKF framework does not provide an efficient mechanism to incorporate prior information on the wide varieties of subsurface geological
structures, and often fails to recover and preserve flow channel structures. Recent works in the area of compressed sensing (CS) have shown that estimating in a sparse domain, using
algorithms such as the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), may significantly improve the estimation quality when dealing with such problems. We propose two new, and computationally
efficient, algorithms combining OMP with the EnKF to improve the estimation and recovery of the subsurface geological channels. Numerical experiments suggest that the proposed
algorithms provide efficient mechanisms to incorporate and preserve structural information in the EnKF and result in significant improvements in recovering flow channel structures.},

abstract={Recently, a new polynomial basis over binary extension fields was proposed, such that the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over such fields can be computed in the complexity of
order O(n lg(n)), where n is the number of points evaluated in FFT. In this paper, we reformulate this FFT algorithm, such that it can be easier understood and be extended to develop
frequencydomain decoding algorithms for (n=2m, k) systematic Reed-Solomon (RS) codes over F2m, m ∈ Z+, with n- k a power of two. First, the basis of syndrome polynomials is
reformulated in the decoding procedure so that the new transforms can be applied to the decoding procedure. A fast extended Euclidean algorithm is developed to determine the error
locator polynomial. The computational complexity of the proposed decoding algorithm is O(n lg(n-k)+(n-k) lg2(n-k)), improving upon the best currently available decoding complexity O(n
lg2(n) lglg(n)), and reaching the best known complexity bound that was established by Justesen in 1976. However, Justesen's approach is only for the codes over some specific fields,
which can apply Cooley-Tukey FFTs. As revealed by the computer simulations, the proposed decoding algorithm is 50 times faster than the conventional one for the (216, 215) RS code over

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of reducing the delivery time of data messages to cellular users using instantly decodable network coding (IDNC) with physical-layer rate
awareness. While most of the existing literature on IDNC does not consider any physical layer complications and abstracts the model as equally slotted time for all users, this paper
proposes a cross-layer scheme that incorporates the different channel rates of the various users in the decision process of both the transmitted message combinations and the rates with
which they are transmitted. The consideration of asymmetric rates for receivers reflects more practical application scenarios and introduces a new tradeoff between the choice of coding
combinations for various receivers and the broadcasting rates. The completion time minimization problem in such a scenario is first shown to be intractable. The problem is thus
approximated by reducing, at each transmission, the increase of an anticipated version of the completion time. This paper solves the problem by formulating it as a maximum weight
clique problem over a newly designed rate-aware IDNC graph. The highest weight clique in the created graph being potentially not unique, this paper further suggests a multi-layer
version of the proposed solution to improve the obtained results from the employed completion time approximation. Simulation results indicate that the cross-layer design largely
outperforms the uncoded transmissions strategies and the classical IDNC scheme.},

abstract={Subsurface reservoir flow channels are characterized by high-permeability values and serve as preferred pathways for fluid propagation. Accurate estimation of their
geophysical structures is thus of great importance for the oil industry. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a widely used statistical technique for estimating subsurface reservoir
model parameters. However, accurate reconstruction of the subsurface geological features with the EnKF is challenging because of the limited measurements available from the wells and
the smoothing effects imposed by the ℓ2-norm nature of its update step. A new EnKF scheme based on sparse domain representation was introduced by Sana et al. (2015) to incorporate
useful prior structural information in the estimation process for efficient recovery of subsurface channels. In this paper, we extend this work in two ways: 1) investigate the effects
of incorporating time-lapse seismic data on the channel reconstruction; and 2) explore a Bayesian sparse reconstruction algorithm with the potential ability to reduce the computational
requirements. Numerical results suggest that the performance of the new sparse Bayesian based EnKF scheme is enhanced with the availability of seismic measurements, leading to further
improvement in the recovery of flow channels structures. The sparse Bayesian approach further provides a computationally efficient framework for enforcing a sparse solution, especially
with the possibility of using high sparsity rates through the inclusion of seismic data.},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of channel impulse response estimation for cluster-sparse channels under the Bayesian estimation framework. We develop a novel low-complexity

Toeplitz/circulant structure of the measurement matrix, a channel impulse response, such as underwater acoustic channel impulse responses, can be partitioned into a number of
orthogonal or approximately orthogonal clusters. The orthogonal clusters, the sparsity of the channel impulse response, and the structure of the measurement matrix, all combined,
result in a computationally superior realization of the MMSE channel estimator. The MMSE estimator calculations boil down to simpler in-cluster calculations that can be reused in
different clusters. The reduction in computational complexity allows for a more accurate implementation of the MMSE estimator. The proposed approach is tested using synthetic Gaussian
channels, as well as simulated underwater acoustic channels. Symbol-error-rate performance and computation time confirm the superiority of the proposed method compared to selected

abstract={This paper considers the effect of spatial correlation between transmit antennas on the sum-rate capacity of the MIMO Gaussian broadcast channel (i.e., downlink of a cellular

antennas, P is the average signal to noise ratio, and o(1) refers to terms that go to zero as n rarr infin. When the channel exhibits some spatial correlation with a covariance matrix
R (non-singular with tr(R)=M), we prove that the sum rate of dirty paper coding is M log log n + M log P/M + log det(R) + o(1). We further show that the sum-rate of various

pages={4882-4895},
abstract={In this paper, a low-sampling-rate scheme for ultra-wideband channel estimation is proposed. The scheme exploits multiple observations generated by transmitting multiple
pulses. In the proposed scheme, $P$ pulses are transmitted to produce channel impulse response estimates at a desired sampling rate, while the ADC samples at a rate that is $P$ times
slower. To avoid loss of fidelity, the number of sampling periods (based on the desired rate) in the inter-pulse interval is restricted to be co-prime with $P$ . This condition is
affected when clock drift is present and the transmitted pulse locations change. To handle this case, and to achieve an overall good channel estimation performance, without using prior
information, we derive an improved estimator based on the bounded data uncertainty (BDU) model. It is shown that this estimator is related to the Bayesian linear minimum mean squared
error (LMMSE) estimator. Channel estimation performance of the proposed sub-sampling scheme combined with the new estimator is assessed in simulation. The results show that high
reduction in sampling rate can be achieved. The proposed estimator outperforms the least squares estimator in almost all cases, while in the high SNR regime it also outperforms the
LMMSE estimator. In addition to channel estimation, a synchronization method is also proposed that utilizes the same pulse sequence used for channel estimation.},

the cloud is only responsible for the scheduling policy, power control, and synchronization of the transmit frames across the single-antenna base-stations (BS). The transmit frame
consists of several time/frequency blocks, called power-zones (PZs). The paper considers the problem of scheduling users to PZs and determining their power levels (PLs), by maximizing
the weighted sum-rate under the practical constraints that each user cannot be served by more than one base-station, but can be served by one or more power-zones within each
base-station frame. The paper solves the problem using a graph theoretical approach by introducing the joint scheduling and power control graph formed by several clusters, where each
is formed by a set of vertices, representing the possible association of users, BSs, and PLs for one specific PZ. The problem is, then, formulated as a maximum-weight clique problem,
in which the weight of each vertex is the sum of the benefits of the individual associations belonging to that vertex. Simulation results suggest that the proposed cross-layer scheme

The proposed algorithm does not require any statistical information about the channel and thus does not suffer from latency normally associated with blind methods. The paper
demonstrates how to reduce the complexity of the algorithm, which becomes especially low at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Specifically, it is shown that in the high SNR regime, the

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of estimating sparse channels in massive MIMO-OFDM systems. Most wireless channels are sparse in nature with large delay spread. In addition,
these channels as observed by multiple antennas in a neighborhood have approximately common support. The sparsity and common support properties are attractive when it comes to the
efficient estimation of large number of channels in massive MIMO systems. Moreover, to avoid pilot contamination and to achieve better spectral efficiency, it is important to use a
small number of pilots. We present a novel channel estimation approach which utilizes the sparsity and common support properties to estimate sparse channels and requires a small number
of pilots. Two algorithms based on this approach have been developed that perform Bayesian estimates of sparse channels even when the prior is non-Gaussian or unknown. Neighboring
antennas share among each other their beliefs about the locations of active channel taps to perform estimation. The coordinated approach improves channel estimates and also reduces the
required number of pilots. Further improvement is achieved by the data-aided version of the algorithm. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the
proposed algorithms.},

central controller or additional signaling in the system. The session is modeled by self-interested players in a non-cooperative potential game. The utility functions are designed so
as increasing individual payoff results in a collective behavior which achieves both a desirable system performance in a shared network environment and the Nash equilibrium. Three
games are developed whose first reduces the completion time, the second the maximum decoding delay and the third the sum decoding delay. The paper, further, improves the formulations
by including a punishment policy upon collision occurrence so as to achieve the Nash bargaining solution. Learning algorithms are proposed for systems with complete and incomplete
information, and for the imperfect feedback scenario. Numerical results suggest that the proposed game-theoretical formulation provides appreciable performance gain against the
conventional point-to-multipoint (PMP), especially for reliable user-to-user channels.},

pages={98-104},
abstract={The rapid pace of demand for mobile data services and the limited supply of capacity in the current wireless access networks infrastructure are leading network operators to
increase the density of base station deployments to improve network performance. This densification, made possible by small-cell deployment, also brings a novel set of challenges,
specifically related to the cost of ownership, in which backhaul is of primary concern. This article proposes a cost-effective hybrid RF/free-space optical (FSO) solution to combine
the advantages of RF backhauls (low cost, NLOS applications) and FSO backhauls (high-rate, low latency). To first illustrate the cost advantages of the RF backhaul solution, the first
part of this article presents a business case of NLOS wireless RF backhaul, which has a low cost of ownership as compared to other backhaul candidates. RF backhaul, however, is limited
by latency problems. On the other side, an FSO solution, which offers better latency and higher data rate than RF backhauls, remains sensitive to weather and nature conditions (e.g.,
rain, fog). To combine RF and FSO advantages, the second part of this article proposes a lowcost hybrid RF/FSO solution, wherein base stations are connected to each other using either
optical fiber or hybrid RF/FSO links. This part addresses the problem of minimizing the cost of backhaul planning under reliability, connectivity, and data rate constraints, and
proposes choosing the appropriate cost-effective backhaul connection between BSs (i.e., either OF or hybrid RF/FSO) using graph theory techniques.},

abstract={Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) combines the advantages of high performance and relatively low implementation complexity. However, for reliable coherent
detection of the input signal, the OFDM receiver needs accurate channel information. When the channel exhibits fast time variation as it is the case with several recent OFDM-based
mobile broadband wireless standards (e.g., WiMAX, LTE, DVB-H), channel estimation at the receiver becomes quite challenging for two main reasons: 1) the receiver needs to perform this
estimation more frequently and 2) channel time-variations introduce intercarrier interference among the OFDM subcarriers which can degrade the performance of conventional channel
estimation algorithms significantly. In this paper, we propose a new pilot-aided algorithm for the estimation of fast time-varying channels in OFDM transmission. Unlike many existing
OFDM channel estimation algorithms in the literature, we propose to perform channel estimation in the frequency domain, to exploit the structure of the channel response (such as
frequency and time correlations and bandedness), optimize the pilot group size and perform most of the computations offline resulting in high performance at substantial complexity
reductions.},

abstract={This paper presents a comprehensive performance analysis of full-duplex multiuser relay networks employing opportunistic scheduling with noisy and compressive feedback.
Specifically, two feedback techniques based on compressive sensing (CS) theory are introduced and their effect on the system performance is analyzed. The problem of joint user identity
and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation at the base-station is casted as a block sparse signal recovery problem in CS. Using existing CS block recovery algorithms, the identity of
the strong users is obtained and their corresponding SNRs are estimated using the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE). To minimize the effect of feedback noise on the estimated SNRs,
a backoff strategy that optimally backsoff on the noisy estimated SNRs is introduced, and the error covariance matrix of the noise after CS recovery is derived. Finally, closed-form
expressions for the end-to-end SNRs of the system are derived. Numerical results show that the proposed techniques drastically reduce the feedback air-time and achieve a rate close to
that obtained by scheduling techniques that require dedicated error-free feedback from all network users. Key findings of this paper suggest that the choice of half-duplex or
full-duplex SNR feedback is dependent on the channel coherence interval, and on low coherence intervals, full-duplex feedback is superior to the interference-free half-duplex
feedback.},

challenging, problem. Traditional technologies for backhaul networks, including either radio-frequency (RF) backhauls or optical fibers (OF). While RF is a cost-effective solution as
compared with OF, it supports the lower data rate requirements. Another promising backhaul solution is the free-space optics (FSO) as it offers both a high data rate and a relatively
low cost. The FSO, however, is sensitive to nature conditions, e.g., rain, fog, and line-of-sight. This paper combines both the RF and FSO advantages and proposes a hybrid RF/FSO
backhaul solution. It considers the problem of minimizing the cost of the backhaul network by choosing either OF or hybrid RF/FSO backhaul links between the base stations, so as to
satisfy data rate, connectivity, and reliability constraints. It shows that under a specified realistic assumption about the cost of OF and hybrid RF/FSO links, the problem is
equivalent to a maximum weight clique problem, which can be solved with moderate complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed solution shows a close-to-optimal performance,
especially for reasonable prices of the hybrid RF/FSO links. They further reveal that the hybrid RF/FSO is a cost-efficient solution and a good candidate for upgrading the existing

the signal. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the source-node correlation (the correlation between sensor node observations and the source signal) and the inter-node
correlation (the correlation between sensor node observations) on the performance of the Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE) estimator for three correlation models in the presence
of channel fading. First, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the achieved distortion (i.e., MSE) resulting from both the observation and channel noise in a non-fading channel.
Then, the effect of channel fading is considered and the corresponding distortion outage probability, the probability that the distortion exceeds a certain value, is found. By
representing the distortion as a ratio of indefinite quadratic forms, a closed-form expression is derived for the outage probability that shows its dependency on the correlation.
Finally, the new representation of the outage probability allows us to propose an iterative solution for the power allocation problem to minimize the outage probability under total and
individual power constraints. Numerical simulations are provided to verify our analytic results.},

abstract={Clipping is one of the simplest peak-to-average power ratio reduction schemes for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Deliberately clipping the transmission
signal degrades system performance, and clipping mitigation is required at the receiver for information restoration. In this paper, we acknowledge the sparse nature of the clipping
signal and propose a low-complexity Bayesian clipping estimation scheme. The proposed scheme utilizes a priori information about the sparsity rate and noise variance for enhanced
recovery. At the same time, the proposed scheme is robust against inaccurate estimates of the clipping signal statistics. The undistorted phase property of the clipped signal, as well
as the clipping likelihood, is utilized for enhanced reconstruction. Furthermore, motivated by the nature of modern OFDM-based communication systems, we extend our clipping
reconstruction approach to multiple antenna receivers and multi-user OFDM.We also address the problem of channel estimation from pilots contaminated by the clipping distortion.
Numerical findings are presented that depict favorable results for the proposed scheme compared to the established sparse reconstruction schemes.},

abstract={Regenerating codes represent a class of block codes applicable for distributed storage systems. The [n, k, d] regenerating code has data recovery capability while possessing
arbitrary k out of n code fragments, and supports the capability for code fragment regeneration through the use of other arbitrary d fragments, for k ≤ d ≤ n - 1. Minimum storage
regenerating (MSR) codes are a subset of regenerating codes containing the minimal size of each code fragment. The first explicit construction of MSR codes that can perform exact
regeneration (named exact-MSR codes) for d ≥ 2k - 2 has been presented via a product-matrix framework. This paper addresses some of the practical issues on the construction of
exact-MSR codes. The major contributions of this paper include as follows. A new product-matrix framework is proposed to directly include all feasible exact-MSR codes for d ≥ 2k - 2.
The mechanism for a systematic version of exact-MSR code is proposed to minimize the computational complexities for the process of message-symbol remapping. Two practical forms of

abstract={In multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar, for desired transmit beampatterns, appropriate correlated waveforms are designed. To design such waveforms, conventional MIMO
radar methods use two steps. In the first step, the waveforms covariance matrix R is synthesized to achieve the desired beampattern. Whereas in the second step, to realize the
synthesized covariance matrix, actual waveforms are designed. Most of the existing methods use iterative algorithms to solve these constrained optimization problems. The computational
complexity of these algorithms is very high, which makes them difficult to use in practice. In this paper, to achieve the desired beampattern, a low complexity
discrete-Fourier-transform based closed-form covariance matrix design technique is introduced for an MIMO radar. The designed covariance matrix is then exploited to derive a novel
closed-form algorithm to directly design the finite-alphabet constant-envelope waveforms for the desired beampattern. The proposed technique can be used to design waveforms for large
antenna array to change the beampattern in real time. It is also shown that the number of transmitted symbols from each antenna depends on the beampattern and is less than the total
number of transmit antenna elements.},

abstract={Optical wireless communications (OWC) is a promising technology for closing the mismatch between the growing number of connected devices and the limited wireless network
capabilities. Similar to downlink, uplink can also benefit from OWC for establishing connectivity between such devices and an optical access point. In this context, the incoherent
intensity-modulation and direct-detection (IM-DD) scheme is desirable in practice. Hence, it is important to understand the fundamental limits of communication rates over an OWC uplink
employing IM-DD, i.e., the channel capacity. This uplink, modeled as a Gaussian multiple-access channel (MAC) for indoors OWC, is studied in this paper, under the IM-DD constraints,
which form the main difference with the standard Gaussian MAC commonly studied in the radio-frequency context. Capacity region outer and inner bounds for this channel are derived. The
bounds are fairly close at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), where a truncated-Gaussian input distribution achieves the capacity region within a constant gap. Furthermore, the bounds
coincide at low SNR showing the optimality of ON-OFF keying combined with successive cancellation decoding in this regime. At moderate SNR, an optimized uniformly spaced discrete input
distribution achieves fairly good performance.},

abstract={Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a modulation scheme that is widely used in wired and wireless communication systems. While OFDM is ideally suited to deal
with frequency selective channels and AWGN, its performance may be dramatically impacted by the presence of impulse noise. In fact, very strong noise impulses in the time domain might
result in the erasure of whole OFDM blocks of symbols at the receiver. Impulse noise can be mitigated by considering it as a sparse signal in time, and using recently developed
algorithms for sparse signal reconstruction. We propose an algorithm that utilizes the guard band null subcarriers for the impulse noise estimation and cancellation. Instead of relying
on ℓ1 minimization as done in some popular general-purpose compressive sensing schemes, the proposed method jointly exploits the specific structure of this problem and the available a
priori information for sparse signal recovery. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is very competitive with respect to sparse signal reconstruction schemes based on
ℓ1 minimization. The proposed method is compared with respect to other state-of-the-art methods in terms of achievable rates for an OFDM system with impulse noise and AWGN.},

we propose an OFDMA planning solution for high-speed trains by finding the maximal inter-BS distance, given the required user data rates to perform seamless handover. Our simulation
results illustrate the performance of the proposed resource-allocation schemes in the case of Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long-Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) and

abstract={This paper presents a novel narrowband interference (NBI) mitigation scheme for single carrier-frequency division multiple access systems. The proposed NBI cancellation
scheme exploits the frequency-domain sparsity of the unknown signal and adopts a low complexity Bayesian sparse recovery procedure. At the transmitter, a few randomly chosen data
locations are kept data free to sense the NBI signal at the receiver. Furthermore, it is noted that in practice, the sparsity of the NBI signal is destroyed by a grid mismatch between
the NBI sources and the system under consideration. Toward this end, first, an accurate grid mismatch model is presented that is capable of assuming independent offsets for multiple
NBI sources, and second, the sparsity of the unknown signal is restored prior to reconstruction using a sparsifying transform. To improve the spectral efficiency of the proposed
scheme, a data-aided NBI recovery procedure is outlined that relies on adaptively selecting a subset of data-points and using them as additional measurements. Numerical results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme for NBI mitigation.},

volume={66},

pages={2756-2770},
abstract={For several years, the completion time and the decoding delay problems in instantly decodable network coding (IDNC) were considered separately and were thought to act
completely against each other. Recently, some works have aimed to balance the effects of these two important IDNC metrics, but none of them studied a further optimization of one by
controlling the other. This paper investigates the effect of controlling the decoding delay to reduce the completion time below its currently best known solution in both perfect and
imperfect feedback with persistent erasure channels. To solve the problem, the decoding-delay-dependent expressions of the users' and overall completion times are derived in the
complete feedback scenario. Although using such expressions to find the optimal overall completion time is NP-hard, this paper proposes two novel heuristics that minimize the
probability of increasing the maximum of these decoding-delay-dependent completion time expressions after each transmission through a layered control of their decoding delays.
Afterward, this paper extends the study to the imperfect feedback scenario, in which uncertainties at the sender affect its ability to anticipate accurately the decoding delay increase
at each user. This paper formulates the problem in such an environment and derives the expression of the minimum increase in the completion time. Simulation results show the
performance of the proposed solutions and suggest that both heuristics achieve a lower mean completion time, as compared with the best known heuristics for completion time reduction in
perfect and imperfect feedback. The gap in performance becomes more significant as the erasure of the channel increases.},

abstract={The Received Signal Strength (RSS) based fingerprinting approaches for indoor localization pose a need for updating the fingerprint databases due to dynamic nature of the
indoor environment. This process is hectic and time-consuming when the size of the indoor area is large. The semi-supervised approaches reduce this workload and achieve good accuracy
around 15 percent of the fingerprinting load but the performance is severely degraded if it is reduced below this level. We propose an indoor localization framework that uses
unsupervised manifold alignment. It requires only 1 percent of the fingerprinting load, some crowd sourced readings, and plan coordinates of the indoor area. The 1 percent
fingerprinting load is used only in perturbing the local geometries of the plan coordinates. The proposed framework achieves less than 5 m mean localization error, which is
considerably better than semi-supervised approaches at very small amount of fingerprinting load. In addition, the few location estimations together with few fingerprints help to
estimate the complete radio map of the indoor environment. The estimation of radio map does not demand extra workload rather it employs the already available information from the
proposed indoor localization framework. The testing results for radio map estimation show almost 50 percent performance improvement by using this information as compared to using only
fingerprints.},

abstract={From its introduction to its quindecennial, network coding has built a strong reputation for enhancing packet recovery and achieving maximum information flow in both wired

distributed computing on mobile devices, performance and complexity become both critical factors that affect the efficiency of a coding strategy. Instantly decodable network coding
presents itself as a new paradigm in network coding that trades off these two aspects. This paper review instantly decodable network coding schemes by identifying, categorizing, and
evaluating various algorithms proposed in the literature. The first part of the manuscript investigates the conventional centralized systems, in which all decisions are carried out by
a central unit, e.g., a base-station. In particular, two successful approaches known as the strict and generalized instantly decodable network are compared in terms of reliability,
performance, complexity, and packet selection methodology. The second part considers the use of instantly decodable codes in a device-to-device communication network, in which devices
speed up the recovery of the missing packets by exchanging network coded packets. Although the performance improvements are directly proportional to the computational complexity
increases, numerous successful schemes from both the performance and complexity viewpoints are identified.},

environments. The algorithm makes a collective use of the data and channel constraints inherent in the communication problem. This comes in contrast to other works which have employed
these constraints selectively. The data constraints include pilots, the cyclic prefix, and the finite alphabet restriction, while the channel constraints include sparsity, finite delay
spread, and the statistical properties of the channel (frequency and time correlation). The algorithm boils down to a forward-backward Kalman filter. We also suggest a suboptimal
modification that is able to track the channel and recover the data with no latency. Simulations show the favorable behavior of both algorithms compared to other channel estimation
techniques.},

abstract={This paper presents a unified mathematical paradigm, based on stochastic geometry, for downlink cellular networks with multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) base stations.
The developed paradigm accounts for signal retransmission upon decoding errors, in which the temporal correlation among the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the
original and retransmitted signals is captured. In addition to modeling the effect of retransmission on the network performance, the developed mathematical model presents twofold
analysis unification for the MIMO cellular networks literature. First, it integrates the tangible decoding error probability and the abstracted (i.e., modulation scheme and receiver
type agnostic) outage probability analysis, which are largely disjoint in the literature. Second, it unifies the analysis for different MIMO configurations. The unified MIMO analysis
is achieved by abstracting unnecessary information conveyed within the interfering signals by Gaussian signaling approximation along with an equivalent SISO representation for the
per-data stream SINR in the MIMO cellular networks. We show that the proposed unification simplifies the analysis without sacrificing the model accuracy. To this end, we discuss the
diversity-multiplexing tradeoff imposed by different MIMO schemes and shed light on the diversity loss due to the temporal correlation among the SINRs of the original and retransmitted
signals. Finally, several design insights are highlighted.},
