Alouini,2017 IEEE 27th International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP),Asymptotic performance of regularized quadratic discriminant analysis based classifiers,2017,,,1-6,"This paper carries out a large dimensional analysis of the standard regularized quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) classifier designed on the assumption that data arise from a Gaussian mixture model. The analysis relies on fundamental results from random matrix theory (RMT) when both the number of features and the cardinality of the training data within each class grow large at the same pace. Under some mild assumptions, we show that the asymptotic classification error converges to a deterministic quantity that depends only on the covariances and means associated with each class as well as the problem dimensions. Such a result permits a better understanding of the performance of regularized QDA and can be used to determine the optimal regularization parameter that minimizes the misclassification error probability. Despite being valid only for Gaussian data, our theoretical findings are shown to yield a high accuracy in predicting the performances achieved with real data sets drawn from popular real data bases, thereby making an interesting connection between theory and practice.",Gaussian processes;feature extraction;matrix algebra;optimisation;pattern classification;probability;Gaussian mixture model;RMT;asymptotic classification error;asymptotic performance;dimensional analysis;misclassification error probability;optimal regularization parameter;random matrix theory;regularized QDA;regularized quadratic discriminant analysis based classifiers;training data;Convergence;Covariance matrices;Error analysis;Gaussian distribution;Random variables;Standards;Training;QDA;classification;deterministic equivalent;machine learning;random matrix theory,10.1109/MLSP.2017.8168172,,Jan,Published,2017-01-01 00:00:00

One of these impairments is high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and clipping is the simplest peak reduction scheme. However, in general, when multiple users are subjected to clipping, frequency domain clipping distortions spread over the spectrum of all users. This results in compromised performance and hence clipping distortions need to be mitigated at the receiver. Mitigating these distortions in multiuser case is not simple and requires complex clipping mitigation procedures at the receiver. However, it was observed that interleaved OFDMA presents a special structure that results in only self-inflicted clipping distortions (i.e., the distortions of a particular user do not interfere with other users). In this work, we prove analytically that distortions do not spread over multiple users (while utilizing interleaved carrier assignment in OFDMA) and construct a compressed sensing system that utilizes the sparsity of the clipping distortions and recovers it on each user. We provide numerical results that validate our analysis and show promising performance for the proposed clipping recovery scheme.",OFDM modulation;compressed sensing;distortion;frequency division multiple access;frequency-domain analysis;PAPR;compressed sensing system;frequency domain clipping distortions;interleaved OFDMA systems;orthogonal frequency division multiple access system;peak-to-average power ratio reduction scheme;self-inflicted clipping distortions;signal processing tools;Frequency-domain analysis;Nonlinear distortion;Peak to average power ratio;Receivers;Resource management;Time-domain analysis;Compressed Sensing;Interleaved OFDMA;Nonlinear Distortions;PAPR Reduction,10.1109/ISSPIT.2015.7394419,,Jan,Published,2015-01-01 00:00:00

Usually, the problem is formulated as a minimization problem with a cost function consisting of the square sum of the l 2 norm of the residual error, plus a penalty term of the squared norm of the solution multiplied by a constant. The penalty term has the effect of shrinking the solution towards the origin with magnitude that depends on the value of the penalty constant. By considering both squared and non-squared norms of the residual error and the solution, four different cost functions can be formed to achieve the same goal. In this paper, we show that all the four cost functions lead to the same closed-form solution involving a regularization parameter, which is related to the penalty constant through a different constraint equation for each cost function. We show that for three of the cost functions, a specific procedure can be applied to combine the constraint equation with the mean squared error (MSE) criterion to develop approximately optimal regularization parameter selection algorithms. Performance of the developed algorithms is compared to existing methods to show that the proposed algorithms stay closest to the optimal MSE.",,,,Jan,Published,2017-01-01 00:00:00

A recursive procedure is derived that is based on solving local optimization problems that attempt to alleviate the worst-case effect of data uncertainties on filter performance. The resulting procedure turns out to have similarities with leakage-based adaptive filters. 1 Introduction In real applications there are always discrepancies between an assumed model and the actual data. Such discrepancies or data uncertainties can be due to several factors such as unmodeled dynamics, disturbances, simplifications during the modeling phase, or even finite precision effects. In this paper, we focus on uncertainties in the regression data in the context of adaptive filtering. In particular, we suggest a procedure that attempts to alleviate the worst-case effect of the uncertainties on filter performance.

Furthermore, an extreme densification phase for cellularnetworks is foreseen to fulfill the ambitious fifth generation (5G) performance requirements. Network densification improves spectrum utilization and network capacity by shrinking basestations' (BSs) footprints and reusing the same spectrum more frequently over the spatial domain. However, network densification also increases the handover (HO) rate, which maydiminish the capacity gains for mobile users due to HO delays. In highly dense 5G cellular networks, HO delays may neutralize or even negate the gains offered by network densification.In this paper, we present an analytical paradigm, based on stochastic geometry, to quantify the effect of HO delay on the average user rate in cellular networks. To this end, wepropose a flexible handover scheme to reduce HO delay in case of highly dense cellular networks.

Developing cost efficient backhaul solutions becomes an interesting, yetchallenging, problem. Traditional technologies for backhaul networks include either radio-frequency backhauls (RF) or optical fibres (OF). While RF is a cost-effective solution ascompared to OF, it supports lower data rate requirements. Another promising backhaul solution that may combine both a high data rate and a relatively low cost is the free-space optics(FSO). FSO, however, is sensitive to nature conditions (e.g., rain, fog, line-ofsight, etc.). A more reliable alternative is, therefore, to combine RF and FSO solutions through ahybrid structure called hybrid RF/FSO. Consider a backhaul network, where the base-stations (BS) can be connected to each other either via OF or hybrid RF/FSO backhaul links. The paperaddresses the problem of minimizing the cost of backhaul planning under connectivity and data rates constraints, so as to choose the appropriate costeffective backhaul type between BSs(i.e., either OF or hybrid RF/FSO). The paper solves the problem using graph theory techniques by introducing the corresponding planning graph. It shows that under a specifiedrealistic assumption about the cost of OF and hybrid RF/FSO links, the problem is equivalent to a maximum weight clique problem, which can be solved with moderate complexity.Simulation results show that our proposed solution shows a close-to-optimal performance, especially for practical prices of the hybrid RF/FSO.",cellular radio;cost reduction;graph theory;optical fibre networks;telecommunication network planning;backhaul planning cost minimization;base-stations;cellularnetworks;cost-effective backhaul network design;data rate requirements;free-space optics;graph theory techniques;hybrid FSO backhaul links;hybrid RF backhaul links;hybrid free-spaceoptical technology;hybrid radio technology;maximum weight clique problem;optical fibres;radio-frequency backhauls;Approximation methods;Hybrid power systems;Next generationnetworking;Planning;Radio frequency;Reliability;Transceivers;Network planning;backhaul network design;cost minimization;free-space optic;optical fibre,10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247067,2164-7038,Jan,Published,2015-01-01 00:00:00,,,,,

This allows for high spectralefficiency gains but obviously comes at the cost of higher complexity, a fact that becomes all the more critical as the number of antennas grows large. To solve this issue is to choosea subset of the available n antennas. The subset must be carefully chosen to achieve the best performance.

Nonetheless, channel state information (CSI) fromall users (and cooperating relays) is generally required at a central node in order to make selection decisions. Practically, CSI acquisition generates a great deal of feedbackoverhead that could result in significant transmission delays. In addition to this, the presence of a full-duplex cooperating relay corrupts the fed back CSI by additive noise and therelay's loop (or self) interference. This could lead to transmission outages if user selection is based on inaccurate feedback information. In this paper, we propose an opportunisticfull-duplex feedback algorithm that tackles the above challenges. We cast the problem of joint user signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the relay loop interference estimation at thebase-station as a block sparse signal recovery problem in compressive sensing (CS). Using existing CS block recovery algorithms, the identity of the strong users is obtained and theircorresponding SNRs are estimated. Numerical results show that the proposed technique drastically reduces the feedback overhead and achieves a rate close to that obtained by techniquesthat require dedicated error-free feedback from all users.

This paper considers the more practical scenario of the downlink of a CRAN formed by multiple clouds, where each cloud is connected to acluster of multiple-antenna base stations (BSs) via high-capacity wireline backhaul links. The network is composed of several disjoint BSs' clusters, each serving a pre-known set ofsingle-antenna users.

The paper solves theproblem using Lagrangian duality theory through a dual decomposition approach, which decouples the problem into multiple and independent subproblems, the solution of which depends onthe dual optimization problem. The solution then proceeds in updating the dual variables and the active set of BSs at each cloud iteratively. The proposed approach leads to adistributed implementation across the multiple clouds through a reasonable exchange of information between adjacent clouds.

This paper, instead,considers a hybrid level of coordination for the scheduling problem in the downlink of a multi-cloud radio- access network, so as to benefit from both scheduling policies. Consider amulti-cloud radio access network, where each cloud is connected to several base-stations (BSs) via high capacity links, and therefore allows joint signal processing between them.Across the multiple clouds, however, only scheduling-level coordination is permitted, as it requires a lower level of backhaul communication. The frame structure of every BS iscomposed of various time/frequency blocks, called power- zones (PZs), and kept at fixed power level. The paper addresses the problem of maximizing a network-wide utility by associatingusers to clouds and scheduling them to the PZs, under the practical constraints that each user is scheduled, at most, to a single cloud, but possibly to many BSs within the cloud, andcan be served by one or more distinct PZs within the BSs' frame. The paper solves the problem using graph theory techniques by constructing the conflict graph. The scheduling problemis, then, shown to be equivalent to a maximum- weight independent set problem in the constructed graph, in which each vertex symbolizes an association of cloud, user, BS and PZ, with aweight representing the utility of that association.

We use compressive sensing to find the best user, and show that the proposed protocol requires less time forreservation and so it outperforms other schemes proposed in the literature. Also, as the proposed scheme requires less reservation time, it can be seen as an enhancement for R-ALOHAschemes in fast fading environment.",access protocols;fading channels;multi-access systems;radio networks;MAC protocol;R-ALOHA;channel access;compressive sensing;multiuser diversity;opportunisticprotocol;wireless networks;Access protocols;Diversity reception;Downlink;Fading;Frequency estimation;Media Access Protocol;Throughput;Time measurement;Wireless applicationprotocol;Wireless networks;Compressed sensing;opportunistic communications;protocols;random access;reservation ALOHA;scheduling;wireless networks,10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5450184,2166-9570,Jan,Published,2009-01-01 00:00:00,,,,,

This approach usesrecent advances in reconstruction of sparse signals from rank-deficient projections using convex programming collectively known as compressive sensing. Since previous work in theliterature has focused on using the reserved tones as spectral support for optimum peak-reducing signals in the time-domain, the complexity at the transmitter was always a problem. Inthis work, we alternatively use extremely simple peak-reducing signals at the transmitter, then use the reserved tones to detect the peak-reducing signal at the receiver by a convexrelaxation of an other-wise combinatorially prohibitive optimization problem.
